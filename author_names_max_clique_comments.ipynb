    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**[OEIS](https://oeis.org/)** is the online encyclopaedia of **integer sequences**. It lists *over 340.000* number sequences in lexicographic order, such as the [prime numbers](http://oeis.org/A000040) or the [Fibonacci sequence](http://oeis.org/A000045), easing the work of countless researchers since 1964, its foundation year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OEIS is made of a series of **JSON files**, one for each integer sequence. Given their regular, human-readable format, these files can be easily manipulated in order to have many of their aspects further analyzed. Indeed, each page of the OEIS not only lists the integers of corresponding sequence, but also a series of information such as formulas, references, links and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work aims to create step-by-step a **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/)** script capable of loading these files and extracting the information thereof contained in order to build a **graph** where:\n",
    "- **nodes** represent all unique **authors** that can be found in each comment of every sequence;\n",
    "- **edges** link two authors who have **commented the same sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library of choice for creating this graph is **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)**, a fast Python module for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure of complex networks. Other data science packages such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are also used for efficiency purposes, as they provide highly optimized functions specifically created for large datasets such as the OEIS encyclopaedia."

    "\n",
    "Before starting, a series of packages must be installed in order for the subsequent code to be executable. The simplest way is to use [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), a package manager for Python callable from the system terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands needed for this operation are listed in the following cell; the Jupyter magic function [`%%cmd`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-bash) (`%%bash` for Unix users) at the beginning allows to use it as a terminal. Make sure to follow the recommended install order, as it helps avoiding errors which can sometimes be generated by the different versions of the packages."

    "## Author parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know where to find the authors' names, we can proceed with building a function to parse all of them from a given file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions\n",
    "The most efficient way of doing this is to use a **regular expression** (also known as *regex*), a sequence of characters that specifies a *search pattern*\\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first identify the ways in which the names have been written; by analyzing some comments, **six main patterns** have been identified, along with the **four regular expressions** needed to match them:\n",
    "1. *\"\\_Name Surname\\_\"* `(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)`\n",
    "2. *\"\\[Name Surname\\]\"* and *\"\\[Surnamea, Surnameb\\]\"* `(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])`\n",
    "3. *\"- Name, Surname ( \"* and *\"\\- Name Surname, \"* `(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )`\n",
    "4. *\"(Name Surname,\"* `(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of their apparent complexity, the meaning of these patterns is quite simple and be easily debugged with tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/). Each of them matches only strings that:\n",
    "- begin with certain characters `_`, `[`, `- `, `(`,\n",
    "    - followed by a capital letter `[A-Z]`,\n",
    "        - not followed by another capital letter `(?!=[A-Z])`,\n",
    "    - followed by at least any two characters `{2,}?`\n",
    "        - at the condition that none of them belong to a list of forbidden symbols `[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]` (where `^` is as a negation operator),\n",
    "- end with certain characters `_`, `]`, `(` or `, `, `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?>=)` and `(?=)` indicate that the matched strings should be preceded or followed (respectively) by the character(s) to the right of the `=` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping certain characters distinguishes them from a regex special symbol (e.g. `\\(\\)` matches the string *()*, while `()` is an empty regex group); whitespaces are simply represented by... a whitespace (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these four expressions with the OR character (`|`) we can create the following regular expression to match all five patterns at once in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)|(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])|(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )|(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About this method's completeness\n",
    "It should be noted that these expressions do not find all the authors present in the comments because they are not written consistently across all sequences. One might argue that it would be sufficient finding all patterns used in order to get all the names; while this would be a good, if not really feasible solution (we do not know how many they are), the problem remains because certain patterns also match formulas and other unrelated data, making them unusable for retrieving only names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive solution would be to either manually get the names, or to allow the matching of extraneous data in order to remove it later from the list of names; this way would take too long, though, and goes beyond the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The parsing function\n",
    "The parsing function gets the **raw data** read by the JSON library in input and returns a **set of all author names** present in the comments of the loaded file (or `None` if there are none).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, after preparing the regex pattern (`re.compile()`), for each `comment` in the non-empty `comment_list` the function gets a list of the authors' names using Python's [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) package for regular expressions, and uses it to update the set of unique authors called `authors` (which contains all names found in the file). The list comprehension in the `update` method is needed to flatten the many lists of lists returned by `re.findall()`."

    "## Graph building\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now proceed by parsing the authors from all OEIS sequences in the `data/sequences` directory and build their graph using the NetworkX library, eventually saving it to disk to avoid having to load every time all the JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that each **node** of the graph should contain the **name of a single author** (without duplicates), we only need to:\n",
    "1. Add each author of each sequence as a node;\n",
    "2. Add edges between all pairs of authors which have commented the same sequence.\n",

    " - parse each sequence file;\n",
    " - extract its authors;\n",
    " - add them as nodes;\n",
    " - create a list of all possible pairs of authors in each sequence;\n",
    " - add an edge for each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first two operations have been already implemented in the previous steps (see the `parse_authors_from_comments()` function), the other two are as simple as two lines of code, knowing that **NetworkX does not complain when adding existing nodes or edges**: we do not need to check every time if a given author has already been inserted or if a certain edge already exists, because the library will *not* duplicate them\\[[2](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/graph.html)\\]. In fact, we could skip the `add_nodes_from()` function, since NetworkX automatically inserts non-existing nodes when adding edges connecting them.\n",
