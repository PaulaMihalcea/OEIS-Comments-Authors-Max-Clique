    "## Author parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know where to find the authors' names, we can proceed with building a function to parse all of them from a given file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions\n",
    "The most efficient way of doing this is to use a **regular expression** (also known as *regex*), a set of characters specifying a *search pattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first identify the ways in which the names have been written; by analyzing some comments, **six main patterns** have been identified, along with the **four regular expressions** needed to match them:\n",
    "1. *\"\\_Name Surname\\_\"* `(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)`\n",
    "2. *\"\\[Name Surname\\]\"* and *\"\\[Surnamea, Surnameb\\]\"* `(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])`\n",
    "3. *\"- Name, Surname ( \"* and *\"\\- Name Surname, \"* `(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )`\n",
    "4. *\"(Name Surname,\"* `(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of their apparent complexity, the meaning of these patterns is quite simple and be easily debugged with tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/). Each of them matches only strings that:\n",
    "- begin with certain characters `_`, `[`, `- `, `(`,\n",
    "    - followed by a capital letter `[A-Z]`,\n",
    "        - not followed by another capital letter `(?!=[A-Z])`,\n",
    "    - followed by at least any two characters `{2,}?`,\n",
    "        - at the condition that none of them belong to a list of forbidden symbols `[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]` (where `^` is as a negation operator),\n",
    "- end with certain characters `_`, `]`, `(` or `, `, `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?>=)` and `(?=)` indicate that the matched strings should be preceded or followed (respectively) by the character(s) to the right of the `=` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping certain characters distinguishes them from a regex special symbol (e.g. `\\(\\)` matches the string *()*, while `()` is an empty regex group); whitespaces are simply represented by, well, a whitespace (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these four expressions with the OR character (`|`) we can create the following regular expression to match all patterns at once in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)|(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])|(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )|(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completeness\n",
    "It should be noted that these expressions **do not find all the authors** present in the comments because they are not written consistently across all sequences. One might argue that it would be sufficient finding all patterns used in order to get all the names; while this would be a good, if not really feasible solution (we do not know how many they are), the problem remains because certain patterns also match formulas and other unrelated data, making them unusable for retrieving only names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive solution would be to either manually get the names, or to allow the matching of extraneous data in order to remove it later from the list of names; this would take too long, though, and goes beyond the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing function\n",
    "The parsing function gets the `dict` **raw data** read by the JSON library in input and returns a **set of all author names** present in the comments of the loaded file (or `None` if there are none).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, after preparing the regex pattern (`re.compile()`), for each `comment` in a non-empty `comment_list` the function gets a list of the authors' names using Python's [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) package for regular expressions, and uses it to update the set of unique authors called `authors` (which contains all names found in the file). The list comprehension in the `update` method is needed to flatten the many lists of lists returned by `re.findall()`."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**[OEIS](https://oeis.org/)** is the online encyclopaedia of **integer sequences**. It lists thousands of number sequences in lexicographic order, such as the [prime numbers](http://oeis.org/A000040) or the [Fibonacci sequence](http://oeis.org/A000045), easing the work of countless researchers since 1964, its foundation year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OEIS is made of a series of **JSON files**, one for each integer sequence. Given their regular, human-readable format, these files can be easily manipulated in order to further analyze them. Indeed, each page of the OEIS not only lists the integers of the corresponding sequence, but also a series of information such as formulas, references, links and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work aims to create, step-by-step, a **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/)** script capable of loading these files and parsing their content in order to build a **graph** where:\n",
    "- **nodes** represent all unique **authors** that can be found in each comment of every sequence, and\n",
    "- **edges** link two authors who have **commented the same sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three main algorithms are then implemented in order to find:\n",
    "1. a **maximal clique**;\n",
    "2. a list of **all maximal cliques**;\n",
    "3. the **maximum clique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library of choice for creating the graph is **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)**, a fast Python module for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure of complex networks. Other libraries such as [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) are also used for efficiency purposes, as they provide highly optimized functions.

    "Before starting, a series of packages must be installed for the subsequent code to be executable. The simplest way is to use [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), a package manager for Python callable from the system terminal.\n",

Make sure to follow the recommended install order, as it helps avoiding errors which can sometimes be generated by different versions of the packages.\n",

    "Now that we know where to find the authors' names, we can proceed with building a function to parse all of them from a given file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions\n",
    "The most efficient way of doing this is to use a **regular expression** (also known as *regex*), a set of characters specifying a *search pattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first identify the ways in which the names have been written; by analyzing some comments, **six main patterns** have been identified, along with the **four regular expressions** needed to match them:\n",
    "1. *\"\\_Name Surname\\_\"* `(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)`\n",
    "2. *\"\\[Name Surname\\]\"* and *\"\\[Surnamea, Surnameb\\]\"* `(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])`\n",
    "3. *\"- Name, Surname ( \"* and *\"\\- Name Surname, \"* `(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )`\n",
    "4. *\"(Name Surname,\"* `(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of their apparent complexity, the meaning of these patterns is quite simple and be easily debugged with tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/). Each of them matches only strings that:\n",
    "- begin with certain characters `_`, `[`, `- `, `(`,\n",
    "    - followed by a capital letter `[A-Z]`,\n",
    "        - not followed by another capital letter `(?!=[A-Z])`,\n",
    "    - followed by at least any two characters `{2,}?`,\n",
    "        - at the condition that none of them belong to a list of forbidden symbols `[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]` (where `^` is as a negation operator),\n",
    "- end with certain characters `_`, `]`, `(` or `, `, `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?>=)` and `(?=)` indicate that the matched strings should be preceded or followed (respectively) by the character(s) to the right of the `=` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping certain characters distinguishes them from a regex special symbol (e.g. `\\(\\)` matches the string *()*, while `()` is an empty regex group); whitespaces are simply represented by, well, a whitespace (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these four expressions with the OR character (`|`) we can create the following regular expression to match all patterns at once in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)|(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])|(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )|(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About this method's completeness\n",
    "It should be noted that these expressions **do not find all the authors** present in the comments because they are not written consistently across all sequences. One might argue that it would be sufficient finding all patterns used in order to get all the names; while this would be a good, if not really feasible solution (we do not know how many they are), the problem remains because certain patterns also match formulas and other unrelated data, making them unusable for retrieving only names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive solution would be to either manually get the names, or to allow the matching of extraneous data in order to remove it later from the list of names; this would take too long, though, and goes beyond the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The parsing function\n",
    "The parsing function gets the `dict` **raw data** read by the JSON library in input and returns a **set of all author names** present in the comments of the loaded file (or `None` if there are none).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, after preparing the regex pattern (`re.compile()`), for each `comment` in a non-empty `comment_list` the function gets a list of the authors' names using Python's [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) package for regular expressions, and uses it to update the set of unique authors called `authors` (which contains all names found in the file). The list comprehension in the `update` method is needed to flatten the many lists of lists returned by `re.findall()`."

    "Considering that each **node** of the graph should contain the **name of a single author** (without duplicates), we only need to:\n",

    " - parse each sequence file;\n",
    " - extract its authors;\n",
    " - add them as nodes;\n",
    " - create a list of all possible pairs of authors in each sequence;\n",
    " - add an edge for each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first two operations have been already implemented in the previous steps (see the `parse_authors_from_comments()` function), the other two are as simple as two lines of code, knowing that **NetworkX does not complain when adding existing nodes or edges**: we do not need to check every time if a given author has already been inserted or if a certain edge already exists, because the library will *not* duplicate them\\[[1](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/graph.html)\\]. In fact, we could even skip the `add_nodes_from()` function, since NetworkX automatically inserts non-existing nodes when adding edges connecting them (which is why it has been commented in the code below).\n",
    "\n",

We learnt about **regular expressions** in order to perform the parsing, and then delved into the variegated world of **cliques** to find one and all maximal cliques of the graph, as well as the largest one.\n",

    "We studied and correctly implemented **four different algorithms**, three of which as different ways to find all cliques, and introduced less popular (but not less important) concepts such as the **degeneracy** of a graph.\n",

    "In the end, we not only reached the main goal of the project by parsing the OEIS files and analyzing the graph, but also created a series of **well-readable and efficient Python implementations** of some significant algorithms, learning along the way about this language's best practices and data structures.\n",

    "The complete code for this project was originally written as a standalone module in the `mihalcea.py` Python file, which can be executed from the command line with an optional boolean argument, `--build_graph`, in order to either build the graph from scratch or load it from an existing JSON file. All functions described can be imported from said script in order to be used independently in other applications, and are fully documented in the `mihalcea.py` script, too."
