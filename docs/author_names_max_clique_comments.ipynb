    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**[OEIS](https://oeis.org/)** is the online encyclopaedia of **integer sequences**. It lists *over 340.000* number sequences in lexicographic order, such as the [prime numbers](http://oeis.org/A000040) or the [Fibonacci sequence](http://oeis.org/A000045), easing the work of countless researchers since 1964, its foundation year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OEIS is made of a series of **JSON files**, one for each integer sequence. Given their regular, human-readable format, these files can be easily manipulated in order to have many of their aspects further analyzed. Indeed, each page of the OEIS not only lists the integers of corresponding sequence, but also a series of information such as formulas, references, links and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work aims to create, step-by-step, a **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/)** script capable of loading these files and parsing their content in order to build a **graph** where:\n",
    "- **nodes** represent all unique **authors** that can be found in each comment of every sequence;\n",
    "- **edges** link two authors who have **commented the same sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three algorithms are then implemented in order to find:\n",
    "- a maximal clique;\n",
    "- a list of all maximal cliques;\n",
    "- the maximum clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library of choice for creating the graph is **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)**, a fast Python module for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure of complex networks. TODO Other data science packages such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are also used for efficiency purposes, as they provide highly optimized functions specifically created for large datasets such as the OEIS encyclopaedia.\n",
    "TODO Other Python libraries such as [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), and [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) are also used for efficiency purposes, as they provide highly optimized functions specifically created for large datasets such as the OEIS encyclopaedia."

    "\n",
    "Before starting, a series of packages must be installed in order for the subsequent code to be executable. The simplest way is to use [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), a package manager for Python callable from the system terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands needed for this operation are listed in the following cell; the Jupyter magic function [`%%cmd`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-bash) (`%%bash` for Unix users) at the beginning allows to use it as a terminal. Make sure to follow the recommended install order, as it helps avoiding errors which can sometimes be generated by the different versions of the packages."

    "The most efficient way of doing this is to use a **regular expression** (also known as *regex*), a sequence of characters that specifies a *search pattern*\\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first identify the ways in which the names have been written; by analyzing some comments, **six main patterns** have been identified, along with the **four regular expressions** needed to match them:\n",
    "1. *\"\\_Name Surname\\_\"* `(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)`\n",
    "2. *\"\\[Name Surname\\]\"* and *\"\\[Surnamea, Surnameb\\]\"* `(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])`\n",
    "3. *\"- Name, Surname ( \"* and *\"\\- Name Surname, \"* `(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )`\n",
    "4. *\"(Name Surname,\"* `(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of their apparent complexity, the meaning of these patterns is quite simple and be easily debugged with tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/). Each of them matches only strings that:\n",
    "- begin with certain characters `_`, `[`, `- `, `(`,\n",
    "    - followed by a capital letter `[A-Z]`,\n",
    "        - not followed by another capital letter `(?!=[A-Z])`,\n",
    "    - followed by at least any two characters `{2,}?`\n",
    "        - at the condition that none of them belong to a list of forbidden symbols `[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]` (where `^` is as a negation operator),\n",
    "- end with certain characters `_`, `]`, `(` or `, `, `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?>=)` and `(?=)` indicate that the matched strings should be preceded or followed (respectively) by the character(s) to the right of the `=` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping certain characters distinguishes them from a regex special symbol (e.g. `\\(\\)` matches the string *()*, while `()` is an empty regex group); whitespaces are simply represented by... a whitespace (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these four expressions with the OR character (`|`) we can create the following regular expression to match all five patterns at once in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(?<=_)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=_)|(?<=\\[)[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=\\])|(?<=- )[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?= \\(|, )|(?<=\\()[A-Z](?!=[A-Z])[^0-9+\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}\\\\\\/_:;\"\"]{2,}?(?=,)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About this method's completeness\n",
    "It should be noted that these expressions do not find all the authors present in the comments because they are not written consistently across all sequences. One might argue that it would be sufficient finding all patterns used in order to get all the names; while this would be a good, if not really feasible solution (we do not know how many they are), the problem remains because certain patterns also match formulas and other unrelated data, making them unusable for retrieving only names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive solution would be to either manually get the names, or to allow the matching of extraneous data in order to remove it later from the list of names; this way would take too long, though, and goes beyond the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The parsing function\n",
    "The parsing function gets the **raw data** read by the JSON library in input and returns a **set of all author names** present in the comments of the loaded file (or `None` if there are none).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, after preparing the regex pattern (`re.compile()`), for each `comment` in the non-empty `comment_list` the function gets a list of the authors' names using Python's [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) package for regular expressions, and uses it to update the set of unique authors called `authors` (which contains all names found in the file). The list comprehension in the `update` method is needed to flatten the many lists of lists returned by `re.findall()`."

    "### Definitions\n",
    "Let $G = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ be an undirected graph where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of all nodes and $\\mathcal{E}$ the set of all edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **clique** of $G$ is a **complete subgraph**\\[[4](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Clique.html)\\], or a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge\\[[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph)\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "A **maximal clique** is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, meaning it is not a subset of a larger clique. The **maximum clique** in a graph (i.e. the clique of largest size) is always maximal, while the converse does not hold\\[[6](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximalClique.html)\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm\n",
    "In order to find one or all maximal cliques in our graph, as well as the maximum clique, we can proceed by implementing the **Bron-Kerbosch algorithm**\\[[7](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362342.362367)\\], designed by its Dutch namesakes in 1973 and widely used in its variants for finding many types of communities (subsets of nodes more densely connected than the rest of the network) in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm solves the following **core problem**\\[[8](https://e-l.unifi.it/course/view.php?id=20118)\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given three sets $R$, $P$ and $X$, find all maximal cliques that include:\n",
    "> - all of the vertices in $R$;\n",
    "> - some of the vertices in $P$;\n",
    "> - none of the vertices in $X$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Assuming that $P \\cap X = \\emptyset$, and for each $v \\in P \\cup X$, $R \\cup \\{v\\}$ is a clique, i.e. $v \\in \\mathcal{N}(R)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all maximal cliques of graph $G$, we only need to initially set $R = \\emptyset$, $P = \\mathcal{V}$ and $X = \\emptyset$. After running the algorithm described in the pseudocode below, whenever $P = \\emptyset$ and $X = \\emptyset$ then there are no further elements that can be added to $R$, so $R$ is a maximal clique and the algorithm outputs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bron-Kerbosch(R, P, X):\n",
    "    if P and X are both empty:\n",
    "        report R as a maximal clique\n",

    "        X = X ‚ãÉ {v}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $X$ of vertices avoids listing cliques that have already been found, meaning that Bron-Kerbosch **lists each solution exactly once**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted, however, that often we lose time going in dead-ends, since every time $P = \\emptyset$ and $X = \\emptyset$ we back-track without producing anything.\n",

    "#### Bron-Kerbosch with Tomita pivoting\n",
    "The number of bad cases (where $P = \\emptyset$ and $X = \\emptyset$) can be reduced by choosing a pivot vertex $u$ from $P \\cup X$: any maximal clique must then include either $u$ or one of its non-neighbors, or otherwise the clique could be augmented by adding $u$ to it. Hence, only $u$ and its non-neighbors need to be tested as the choices for the vertex $v$ that is added to $R$ in each recursive call to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple, effective way to choose the pivot is called the **Tomita pivoting**\\[[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397506003586)\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The pivot $u \\in P \\cup X$ is the node having more neighbors in $P$\n",

    "    if P and X are both empty:\n",
    "        report R as a maximal clique\n",
    "    choose pivot vertex u in P ‚ãÉ X such that it is the node having more neighbors in P\n",

    "        P = P \\ {v}\n",
    "        X = X ‚ãÉ {v}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity\n",
    "The worst-case analysis for the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm with a pivot strategy matches the bound in \\[[10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02760024)\\], which proves that any $n$-vertex graph has at most $3^{\\frac{n}{3}}$ maximal cliques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although other algorithms for solving the maximal clique problem yield better results on certain types of input, it has been frequently reported that in practice the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, with its $O(3^{\\frac{n}{3}})$ **worst-case time complexity**, is more **efficient** than its alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python maximal cliques algorithms\n",

    "3. the maximum clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm 1: finding a maximal clique\n",
    "The easiest way to perform this operation is to implement the efficient Bron-Kerbosch algorithm in such a way that it stops after having found a single maximal clique, which can be done with the following code:"
