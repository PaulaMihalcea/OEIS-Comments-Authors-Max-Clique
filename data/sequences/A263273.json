As these rules do not depend on which direction they are applied from, it means that this bijection preserves the fact whether a number is divisible by 2, 4 or 8, or whether it is not. Thus natural numbers are divided to several subsets, each of which is closed with respect to this bijection. See the Crossrefs section for permutations obtained from these sections.", "When polynomials over GF(3) are encoded as natural numbers (coefficients presented with the digits of the base-3 expansion of n), this bijection works as a multiplicative automorphism of the ring GF(3)[X]. This follows from the fact that as there are no carries involved, the multiplication (and thus also the division) of such polynomials could be as well performed by temporarily reversing all factors (like they were seen through mirror). This implies also that the sequences A207669 and A207670 are closed with respect to this bijection."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A263273/b263273.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..6561</a>", "Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule\">Divisibility rule</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Per#IntegerPermutation\">Index entries for sequences that are permutations of the natural numbers</a>"], "formula": ["a(0) = 0; for n >= 1, a(n) = A030102(A038502(n)) * A038500(n).", "Other identities.
