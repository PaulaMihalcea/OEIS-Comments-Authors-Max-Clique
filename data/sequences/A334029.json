For example, the co-Lyndon product of (2,3,1) with (2,1,3) is (2,1,2,3,1,3), the product of (2,2,1) with (2,1,3) is (2,1,2,2,1,3), and the product of (1,2,2) with (2,1,2,1) is (1,2,1,2,1,2,2). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1,0,0,1) has co-Lyndon factorization {(1),(1,0,0)}.", "A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."], "example": ["The 441st composition in standard order is (1,2,1,1,3,1), with co-Lyndon factorization {(1),(3,1),(2,1,1)}, so a(441) = 3."], "mathematica": ["stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;", "colynQ[q_]:=Length[q]==0||Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#1],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#1],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]][Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#1]]&]]]]", "Table[Length[colynfac[stc[n]]],{n,0,100}]"], "xref": ["The dual version is A329312.", "The version for binary expansion is (also) A329312.", "The version for reversed binary expansion is A329326.", "Binary Lyndon/co-Lyndon words are counted by A001037.", "Necklaces covering an initial interval are A019536.", "Lyndon/co-Lyndon compositions are counted by A059966", "Length of Lyndon factorization of binomial expansion is A211100.", "Numbers whose prime signature is a necklace are A329138.", "Length of Lyndon factorization of reversed binary expansion is A329313.", "A list of all binary co-Lyndon words is A329318.", "All of the following pertain to compositions in standard order (A066099):", "- Length is A000120.", "- Necklaces are A065609.", "- Sum is A070939.", "- Runs are counted by A124767.", "- Rotational symmetries are counted by A138904.", "- Strict compositions are A233564.", "- Constant compositions are A272919.", "- Lyndon compositions are A275692.", "- Co-Lyndon compositions are A326774.", "- Aperiodic compositions are A328594.", "- Reversed co-necklaces are A328595.", "- Rotational period is A333632.", "- Co-necklaces are A333764.", "- Co-Lyndon factorizations are counted by A333765.", "- Lyndon factorizations are counted by A333940.", "- Reversed necklaces are A333943.", "- Co-necklaces are A334028.", "Cf.
