For 0 < p < 1 and positive integers N and G with N < G, suppose you begin with N dollars and make repeated wagers, each time winning 1 dollar with probability p and losing 1 dollar with probability 1-p. You continue betting 1 dollar at a time until you have either G dollars (your Goal) or 0 (bankrupt). What is the probability of reaching your Goal before going bankrupt, as a function of p, N, and G? (This is a type of one-dimensional random walk.) Answer: Let Q_m_(x) be the polynomial whose coefficients are given by row m-1 of the triangle (e.g., Q_6_(x) = 1 - 4x + 7x^2 - 6x^3 + 3x^4).
