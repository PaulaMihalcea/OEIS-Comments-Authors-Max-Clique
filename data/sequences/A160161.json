The sequence can be written as a table with rows r >= 0 of length 1, 1, 1, 3, 9, 18, 36, ... = 9*2^(r-4) for row r >= 4. In that case, rows 0..3 are filled with 2^r, and all rows r >= 3 have the form (x_r, y_r, x_r) where x_r and y_r have 3*2^(r-4) elements, all multiples of 8. Moreover, y_r[1] = a(A033484(r-2)) = x_{r+1}[1] = a(A176449(r-3)) is the largest element of row r and thus a record value of the sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 11 2018"], "link": ["M. F.
