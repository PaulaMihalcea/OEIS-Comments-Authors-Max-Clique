These are quadratic Jacobi matrices J_n with nonnegative entries. The corresponding graphs could be called Jacobi graphs. Here Chebyshev S-polynomials (coefficients A049310) are considered, which belong to the Jacobi class of the classical orthogonal polynomial systems. The corresponding graph has adjacency matrix [[0,1,0,...],[1,0,1,...],[0,1,0,1,...]...[0,...0,1,0]] (n rows and n columns), with characteristic polynomial S(n,x) (see also a comment by _Michael Somos_ on A049310).", "w(n,l;p_k->p_m) = ((J_n)^l)(k,m) is the number of walks of length l from vertex p_k to vertex p_m on such a Jacobi graph. w(n,0; p_k->p_m) = delta(k,m), with the Kronecker symbol delta. The total number of closed walks of length l is w(n,l):=Sum_{i=1..n} w(n,l; p_i->p_i) = trace(J_n^l), which is the l-th power sum of the eigenvalues of J_n, i.e., the zeros of the characteristic polynomial for J_n. There are theorems for the o.g.f. of the normalized power sums of these zeros. See, e.g., the given W. Lang reference, p. 244. This results for the S-polynomial in the o.g.f. G(n,x) = Sum_{l=0..infinity} w(n,l)*x^l = y*(d/dy)S(n,y)/S(y) with y=1/x. This can be rewritten in the form given in the formula section (this results from eq. (3.8b) of the W. Lang reference, and in eq. (3.8d) it should be coth, not tanh).", "From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 10 2012: (Start)", "For an accompanying paper on path counting on Jacobi graphs see the W.
