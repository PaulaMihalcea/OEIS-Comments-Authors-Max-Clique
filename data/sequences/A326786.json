The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18.", "Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. The cut-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (together with any resulting empty or duplicate edges) to obtain a disconnected or empty set-system.
