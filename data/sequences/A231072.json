The choice of long or short scale does not make a difference since, e.g., the word \"milliard\" in long scale use would simply be replaced by \"billion\" in short scale. However, the use of \"thousand [million]\" instead, would lead to different results for numbers such that floor(n/10^6) mod 10^3 is zero. - _M. F.
