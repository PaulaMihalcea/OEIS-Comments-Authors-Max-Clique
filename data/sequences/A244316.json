Then check whether the previous Catalan number, C(m) = A000108(m), where m = k-1, exceeds the remaining n, and if it does not, then subtract that also from n, and keep on doing the same for lesser and lesser Catalan numbers, comparing and also subtracting them (whenever it is possible without going less than zero) from n, until either n becomes zero, or after subtracting C(1) = 1 from n, it still has not reached zero.
