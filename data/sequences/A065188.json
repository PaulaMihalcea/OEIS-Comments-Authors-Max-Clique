They would not occur if the squares on the antidiagonals had been checked for possible positions starting from the opposite end, so as to ensure that the subsequences corresponding to the points on either line would both be increasing. Then one would have that a(n-1) is either round(n*phi)+1 or round(n/phi)+1. (The +-1's could all be avoided if the origin were taken as a(0) = 0 instead of a(1) = 1.) Presently most values are such that either round(n*phi) or round(n/phi) does not differ by more than 1 from a(n-1)-1, except for very few exceptions of the above form (a(42) being the first of these). - _M.
