This significant speed advantage provides the value of the longer analytic program.", "a(n) is also the number of linearly dependent diagonal/side length ratios R(n,k), in the regular n-gon. The following will explain this. In the regular n-gon inscribed in a circle the number of distinct diagonals including the side is floor(n/2). Not all of the corresponding length ratios R(n,k) = d(n,k)/d(n,1), k = 1..floor(n/2), with d(n,1) = s(n) (the length of the side), d(n,2) the length of the smallest diagonal, etc., are linearly independent because C(n,R(n,2)) = 0, where C is the minimal polynomial of R(n,2) = 2*cos(Pi/n) (see A187360) with degree delta(n) = A055034(n). Thus every ratio R(n,j), with j = delta(n)+1, ..., floor(n/2) can be expressed as a linear combination of the independent R(n,k), k=1, ..., delta(n). See the comment from Sep 21 2013 on A053121 for powers of R(n,2) (called there rho(N)). Therefore, a(n) = floor(n/2) - delta(n) is, for n>=2, the number of linearly dependent ratios R(n,k) in the regular n-gon. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 23 2013", "From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 23 2020: (Start)", "This sequence gives the difference between the number of odd numbers in the smallest nonnegative residue system modulo n (called here RS(n)) and the smallest nonnegative restricted residue system (called here RRS(n), but RRS(1) = {1}, not {0}).", "This sequence can be used to find sequence A111774 by recording the positions of the entries >= 1.
