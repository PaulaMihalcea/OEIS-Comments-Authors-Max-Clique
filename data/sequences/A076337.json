However, as of 2009, there are still several smaller numbers which are candidates and have not yet been ruled out (see links).", "Riesel numbers are proved by exhibiting a periodic sequence p of prime divisors with p(k) | n*2^k-1 and disproved by finding prime n*2^k-1. It is conjectured that numbers that cannot be proved Riesel in this way are non-Riesel. However, some numbers resist both proof and disproof.", "Others conjecture the opposite: that there are infinitely many Riesel numbers that do not arise from a covering system, see A101036.- The word \"odd\" is needed in the definition because otherwise for any term n, all numbers n*2^m, m >= 1, would also be Riesel numbers, but we don't want them in this sequence (as is manifest from A101036). Since 1 and 3 obviously aren't in this sequence, for any n in this sequence n-1 is an even number > 2 and therefore composite, so one could replace \"k >= 1\" equivalently by \"k >= 0\". - _M. F.
