A walk in a hypergraph H connecting vertices v0 and vn is a sequence v0, e1, v1, e2, ... , v(n-1), en, vn, where each vi is in V and each ei is in E and for each ei the set {v(i-1),vi} is contained in ei. If for every pair of vertices v and v0 there is a walk in H starting at v and ending at v0 then H is called connected. A walk is a cycle if it contains at least two edges, all of the ei are distinct and all of the vi are distinct except v0 = vn. A connected hypergraph with no cycles is called a hypertree. A rooted hypertree is a hypertree in which one particular vertex is selected as being the root.
