He uses this terminology in several of his papers cited in the links below.", "In the terminology of array A059427, these so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" in permutations defined by Comtet and Andr\u00e9 are called \"alternate runs\" (or just \"runs\").

As mentioned above, other authors call these so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" \"alternate runs\" (or just \"runs\").", "For example, in the permutation 78125436 of [8], we have three maxima, 8, 5, and 6; three minima, 7, 1, and 3; and the so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" (\"alternate runs\") 78, 81, 125, 543, 36 (see p. 122 in Andr\u00e9 (1884)).", "If in the above permutation we take the difference 8-7, 1-8, 2-1, 5-2, 4-5, 3-4, 6-3, we may form a word (list) of signs of consecutive differences: +-++--+.", "In general, if in a permutation of [n], say a_1,a_2,...,a_n (written in one-line notation, but not in cycle notation), we form the differences a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_2, ..., a_n - a_{n-1}, then we get a list of n-1 signs (+ or -).", "For n >= 2, Andr\u00e9 (1885) calls a permutation of [n] \"alternate\" if it has n - 1 so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" (\"alternate runs\"); i.e., if the corresponding list of signs alternates between + and -.

We can reach the same conclusion by looking at its corresponding list of signs +-++--+. The permutation is neither alternate nor quasi-alternate because we have one ++ and one --.", "On p. 316, Andr\u00e9 (1885) gives the following two examples of permutations of [8]: 31426587 and 32541768 (using one-line notation for permutations). The first one has list of signs -+-+-+- while the second one has list of signs -+--+-+. The first one is alternate while the second one is quasi-alternate (because of a single --). Alternatively, the first one has n-1 = 7 so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" (\"alternate runs\")--31, 14, 42, 26, 65, 58, 87--while the second one has n-2 = 6 so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" (\"alternate runs\")--32, 25, 541, 17, 76, 68.", "Here 2*a(n) is the total number of quasi-alternate permutations of [n]. Actually, Andr\u00e9 (1884, 1885) uses P_{n,s} to denote the number of permutations of [n] with exactly s of his so-called \"s\u00e9quences\" (\"alternate runs\"). He uses the notation A_n to denote half the number of alternate permutations of [n] and B_n to denote half the number of quasi-alternate permutations of [n].", "Thus, P_{n,n-1} = 2*A_n = 2*A000111(n) = A001250(n) for n >= 2 and P_{n,n-2} = 2*B_n = 2*a(n) for n >= 2.", "We have P_{n,s} = A059427(n,s) for n >= 2 and s >= 1.
