(2^(k+1))-1 the position of the second most significant 1-bit moves only leftward, i.e., is monotonic, which follows from the recursive formula.", "To see this, consider the first time in this sequence when in a batch of terms (of equal binary width) we have bits in position k (the most significant position) and (k-1) on (that is, both are 1's), the latter corresponding to prime p_k: while in principle a bit-based rule could choose to subtract 2^(k-1), in preference to any 1-bits to the right of it (that correspond to primes p_{i1} .. p_{ih}), it cannot do so at this stage, because it is the second most significant 1-bit, and then it would not move only leftward, contradicting what was said above. Neither this can occur later when more 1-bits have appeared to their left: the recursive formula guarantees it.", "Also conversely, even though p_4 = 7 > 6 = p_1 * p_2, and in general, we always have such prime p_k > p_{i1} * p_{i2} * ... * p_{ih}, with i1, i2, ..., ih < k, and while here A019565-based rule (see comments in A303760) would prefer dividing p_k out instead of any subset of p_{i1} .. p_{ih}, it happens that in that rule, the index of the largest prime (A061395) grows monotonically, so at the stage where p_k is the largest prime of the batch of length 2^(k-1), p_k just cannot be divided out, and also here the structure of the later batches is strictly determined by recursion.", "(End)"], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A303767/b303767.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..16383</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Bi#binary\">Index entries for sequences related to binary expansion of n</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Per#IntegerPermutation\">Index entries for sequences that are permutations of the natural numbers</a>"], "formula": ["a(0) = 0, and for n > 0, if n = 2^k, a(n) = n + a(n-1), otherwise, when n = 2^k + r (with 0 < r < 2^k), then a(n) = 2^k + a(r-1). \\\\ _Antti Karttunen_, May 06 2018", "a(n) = A048675(A303760(n)).", "a(n) = A052331(A303771(n)).", "For all n >= 1, A000523(a(n)) = A000523(n), A007088(a(n)) = A304747(n)."], "example": ["From _Michael De Vlieger_, May 23 2018: (Start)", "Table below shows the initial 17 terms at right.
