Two circulant graphs are Cayley isomorphic if there is a d, which is necessarily prime to n, that transforms through multiplication modulo n the step values of one graph into those of the other. For squarefree n this is the only way that two circulant graphs can be isomorphic.

This sequence differs from A132191 only in that sequence also includes 0 in the domain which introduces an extra factor of m into the results since zero multiplied by anything is zero.", "All column sequences are polynomials of order n-1 and these are the cycle index polynomials.", "This sequence is also related to A075195(n, m) which counts necklaces and A285548(m, n) which is the sequence described in the Titsworth reference.
