Then S is the set of all positive integers, which arise in generations.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2), g(3) = (3,4), g(4) = (6,5,8), g(5) = (7,12,10,9,16), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232559, a permutation of the positive integers.  The number of numbers in g(n) is A000045(n), the n-th Fibonacci number.  It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes and edges from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 2*x if 2*x has not already occurred.  The positions of the odd numbers are given by A026352, and of the evens, by A026351.", "The previously mentioned tree is an example of a fractal tree; that is, an infinite rooted tree T such that every complete subtree of T contains a subtree isomorphic to T.  - _Clark Kimberling_, Jun 11 2016", "The similar sequence S', generated by these rules: 0 is in S', and if x is in S', then 2*x and x+1 are in S', and duplicates are deleted as they occur, appears to equal A048679. - _R\u00e9my Sigrist_, Aug 05 2017"], "link": ["Alois P.
