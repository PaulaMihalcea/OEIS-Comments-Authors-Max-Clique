The empty set is considered to be independent. An independent vertex subset S of a tree is said to be maximal if  every vertex that is not in S is joined by an edge to at least one vertex of S.", "The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.", "Let A(n)=A(n,x), B(n)=B(n,x), C(n)=C(n,x) be the generating polynomial with respect to size of the maximal independent sets that contain the root, the maximal independent sets that do not contain the root, and the independent sets which are not maximal but become maximal if the root is removed, respectively. We have: A(1)=x, B(1)=0, C(1)=1, A(t-th prime) = x[B(t) + C(t)], B(t-th prime) = A(t), C(t-th prime)=B(t), A(rs)=A(r)A(s)/x, B(rs)=B(r)B(s)+B(r)C(s)+B(s)C(r), C(rs)=C(r)C(s) (r,s>=2). The generating polynomial of the maximal independent vertex subsets with respect to size is P(n, x)=A(n,x)+B(n,x). Then a(n)=subs(x=1, dP(n,x)/dx). The Maple program is based on these relations."], "reference": ["F. Goebel, On a 1-1 correspondence between rooted trees and natural numbers, J. Combin. Theory, B 29 (1980), 141-143.", "I.
