Then a(n) is the number of integer partitions of n whose differences (with the last part taken to be 0) are weakly decreasing. The Heinz numbers of these partitions are given by A325364. Of course, the number of such integer partitions of n is also the number of reversed integer partitions of n whose differences (with the first part taken to be 0) are weakly decreasing, which is the author's interpretation. - _Gus Wiseman_, May 03 2019"], "link": ["Fausto A.
