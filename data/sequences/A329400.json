For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100)."], "example": ["Decapitated binary expansions of 1..20 together with their co-Lyndon factorizations:", "   1:     () =", "   2:    (0) = (0)", "   3:    (1) = (1)", "   4:   (00) = (0)(0)", "   5:   (01) = (0)(1)", "   6:   (10) = (10)", "   7:   (11) = (1)(1)", "   8:  (000) = (0)(0)(0)", "   9:  (001) = (0)(0)(1)", "  10:  (010) = (0)(10)", "  11:  (011) = (0)(1)(1)", "  12:  (100) = (100)", "  13:  (101) = (10)(1)", "  14:  (110) = (110)", "  15:  (111) = (1)(1)(1)", "  16: (0000) = (0)(0)(0)(0)", "  17: (0001) = (0)(0)(0)(1)", "  18: (0010) = (0)(0)(10)", "  19: (0011) = (0)(0)(1)(1)", "  20: (0100) = (0)(100)"], "mathematica": ["colynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]]@Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]];", "Table[If[n==0,0,Length[colynfac[Rest[IntegerDigits[n,2]]]]],{n,30}]"], "xref": ["The non-\"co\" version is A211097.", "The version involving all digits is A329312.", "Lyndon and co-Lyndon compositions are (both) counted by A059966.", "Numbers whose reversed binary expansion is Lyndon are A328596.", "Numbers whose binary expansion is co-Lyndon are A275692.", "Numbers whose decapitated binary expansion is co-Lyndon are A329401.", "Cf.
