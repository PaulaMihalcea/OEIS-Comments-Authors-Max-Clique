It appears that n = 2, 7, 61 and 211 are the only numbers for which the triangular number 0 is required in the representation (see A065397). When n is a triangular number, then a(n)=0. Sequence A132399 gives the number of representations of n as p+T. As n becomes larger, the largest prime required to verify the conjecture increases slowly. For example, for n<=10^3, the largest prime required is 953; for n<=10^6 it is 373361; for n<=10^9 it is only 36455351. Using primes less than 10^9, all n<243277591560 have been verified."], "reference": ["Zhi-Wei Sun, On sums of primes and triangular numbers, Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory, 1(2009), no.1, 65-76."], "link": ["T.
