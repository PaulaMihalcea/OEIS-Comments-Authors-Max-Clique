Similar polynomials are treated in Serre's paper. The discriminant of the polynomial is -44 = -4*11. The primes p yielding 3 distinct zeros, A106279, correspond to the periods of the sequences A000073(k) mod p and A001644(k) mod p having length less than p. The Lucas 3-step sequence mod p has two additional primes p for which the period is less than p: 2 and 11, which are factors of the discriminant -44. For p=11, the Fibonacci 3-step sequence mod p has a period of p(p-1)."], "link": ["J.-P.
