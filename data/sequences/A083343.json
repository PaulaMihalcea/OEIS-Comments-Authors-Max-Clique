(Start)", "In a beautifully concise and clear paper, \"Newman's short proof of the prime number theorem\", Don Zagier condensed work by Euler, Riemann, Chebyshev, de la Vallee Poussin, Hadamard, Mertens and, more recently, D. J. Newman (in 1980), to achieve a short self-contained proof of the prime number theorem that is within the reach of a reader who understands enough real analysis to apply the mean-value theorem and enough complex analysis to apply Cauchy's theorem.", "The heart of this proof is the convergence of the integral", "C = int(x = 1, infty, (x - theta(x))/x^2) ... [1]", "where theta(x) = sum(prime p <= x, log(p)) is the sum of the natural logs of all the primes not exceeding x. Then the Prime Number Theorem follows in the form theta(x) ~ x, for otherwise the integral in [1] would not converge.", "In a sense, this constant C is rather significant: if it did not exist the proof would fail. However, its actual value is a matter of sublime indifference to a true mathematician. To prove that it exists, one may use the equivalent expression", "C = 1 + Euler + sum(prime p, log(p)/(p^2-p)) ... [2]", "that follows from Zagier's account. Here the sum is over all the positive primes and clearly converges, since the corresponding sum over integers n > 1 converges.", "It is also easy, if unnecessary, to show that", "C = 1 + Euler + sum(s > 1, mu(s)*zeta'(s)/zeta(s)) ...

An approximate evaluation of this formula requires the derivatives zeta'(s) of Riemann's zeta(s) = sum(n > 0, 1/n^s) at sufficiently many squarefree integers s > 1.", "By use of both [2] and [3], J.
