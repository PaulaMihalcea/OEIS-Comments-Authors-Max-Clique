There is hope that this could be the case, and it seems coherent to choose offset 0 not only in view of this. The restriction to positive indices would then be a permutation of the positive integers, but not the smallest one with the given property.", "Concerning the existence of the sequence: If the sequence is to be computed in a greedy manner, this means that for given n, we assume given P(n) := {a(n-1), a(n-2), a(n-3), a(n-4)} and thus S(n) := #{ primes x + y with x, y in P(n), x < y} which may equal 0, 1, 2 or 3. We have to find a(n) such that we have exactly 3 - S(n) primes in a(n) + P(n). It is easy to prove that this is always possible when 3 - S(n) = 0 or 1, and for S(n) = 0 or 1, this is similar to the case of A329452 or A329453. However, the sequence needs not to be computable in greedy manner. That is, if for given P(n) no a(n) would exist such that a(n) + P(n) contains 3 - S(n) primes, this simply means that the considered value of a(n-1) was incorrect, and the next larger choice has to be made. Given this freedom, well-definedness of this sequence up to infinity is far more probable than, for example, the k-tuple conjecture.", "Computational results are as follows:", "a(10^5) = 99954 and all numbers below 99915 have appeared at that point.", "a(10^6) = 1000053 and all numbers below 999845 have appeared at that point."], "link": ["Eric Angelini, <a href=\"http://cinquantesignes.blogspot.com/2019/11/prime-sums-from-neighbouring-terms.html\">Prime sums from neighbouring terms</a>, personal blog \"Cinquante signes\" (and post to the SeqFan list), Nov. 11, 2019."], "example": ["We start with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, the smallest possibilities which do not lead to a contradiction.", "Now there are already 2 primes, 0 + 2 and 1 + 2, among the pairwise sums, so the next term must generate exactly one further prime.
