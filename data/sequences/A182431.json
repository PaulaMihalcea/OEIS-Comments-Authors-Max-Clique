Each row k contains the positive argument of the largest triangular number equal to or less than 14*k in column 0 and a corresponding 2nd-order recursive sequence G(k) beginning at position a(k,1). Each term G(i) is the same as a(k,i+1). If the product 14*k appears in row \"r\" of the square array A001477, then the product of adjacent terms G(i)*G(i+1), if greater than (r^2 + 3*r - 2)/2, is always in row \"r\" of table A001477. If the product is less than (r^2 +3*r -2)/2, then the product less r would be a triangular number, i.e., still lie in the same row assumed to contain all numbers n that equal a triangular number + r. For example, 3 is a triangular number and appears in row 0 of A001477, but if the rows could take negative indices, A001477(2,-1) would be a 3 so 3 can be said to also lie in row 2. See A182102 for a table of the arguments of the triangular numbers G(i)*G(i+1) - r.", "A property of this table is that a(k+1,i)-a(k,i) directly depends on the value of a(k+1,0)-a(k,0) in the same manner regardless of the value of k. For instance, if a(k+1,0) - a(k,0) = 1 then a(k+1,i+1) - a(k,i+1) equals A182435(i) for all i.
