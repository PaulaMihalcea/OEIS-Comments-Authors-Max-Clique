(The actual sum is about 22.92068.) In 1916, Irwin proved that the sum of 1/n where n has at most a finite number of 9's is also a convergent series. We show how to compute sums of Irwin's series to high precision.", "For example, the sum of the series 1/9 + 1/19 + 1/29 + 1/39 + 1/49 + ..., where the denominators have exactly one 9, is about 23.04428708074784831968. Note that this is larger than the sum of Kempner's \"no 9\" series. We also show how to construct nontrivial subseries of the harmonic series that have arbitrarily large, but computable, sums.
