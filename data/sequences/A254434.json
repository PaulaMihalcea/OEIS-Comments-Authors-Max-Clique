A quandle (Q,*) is a quasigroup if also the mappings L_a: x->a*x are bijections.", "Masahico Saito noticed that there are no Latin keis of even order. Here is a simple proof: Suppose that Q is a Latin kei of order n and that n is even. Let R_a be the permutation of Q given by R_a(x) = x*a. Since R_a is an involution it is a product of t transpositions. Let f be the number of fixed points of R_a. Then n = 2*t + f. Since R_a(a) = a and n is even, there must be a fixed point x different from a. Hence x*a = x and x*x = x. So L_x is not a bijection. This shows that Q is not Latin, so the result is proved.", "There is at least one Latin kei of order n for any odd n: Consider the Latin kei defined on Z/(n) by the rule x*y = -x + 2y.", "Leandro Vendramin (see link below) has found all connected quandles of order n for n at most 47.
