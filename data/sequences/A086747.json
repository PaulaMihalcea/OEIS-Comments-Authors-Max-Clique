J. Mathar_, Apr 19 2013", "This follows from the definition of the sequence: 4x appends an even number of zeros, while 2x+1 appends a 1. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 21 2013", "From _Kevin Ryde_, Jan 23 2020: (Start)", "Baum and Sweet consider Laurent series with coefficients mod 2 (GF2[1/x]) and continued fractions developed from such series.  One they consider is the unique solution to f(x)^3 + (1/x)*f(x) + 1 = 0, which is f(x) = 1 + 1/x + 0/x^2 + 1/x^3 + ...  The coefficients of f are the Baum-Sweet sequence, which is the present sequence except a(0)=1.", "Baum and Sweet (remark with theorem 2) note that term f_n/x^n has coefficient f_n = 1 if and only if n has only even runs of 0-bits in its binary expansion.  They write such f_n just for n>=1, but the constant term 1 in f(x) would be an f_0 = 1.", "This bit-wise form follows from the generating function solution by firstly x instead of 1/x so g(x)^3 + x*g(x) + 1 = 0, then f(x)^2=f(x^2) which is true of any series with coefficients mod 2, then multiply through by g(x) so g(x) = x*g(x^2) + g(x^4).  x*g(x^2) copies a(n) to odd terms a(2n+1) (so its own odd bisection).  g(x^4) copies a(n) to a(4n) similarly.  Nothing is copied to 4n+2 so those terms are 0.  These are the recurrence below.  Repeatedly applied, even-length runs of 0-bits are skipped until reaching final a(0)=1.", "The bit-wise form (rather than f(x) solution) is often used as the definition of the sequence.  It can be recognised by a state machine, as per Allouche and Shallit.  They include a(0)=1 from Baum and Sweet's series (which Merta, and Winter et al, follow too).", "The choice of a(0)=0 or a(0)=1 in a bit-wise definition is whether n=0 comprises one 0-bit, or no bits at all.  A strong argument can be made for a(0)=1 by noting that high 0-bits are not considered when testing runs of 0s in an n>=1, and ignoring all high 0s in n=0 leaves an empty bit string, which is no odd run of 0s.  Allouche and Shallit's state A skips optional leading 0s explicitly.  Their output value 1 there gives a(0)=1 for n=0 as any number of 0-bits (none, one, more).", "(End)"], "reference": ["J.-P.
