The only even number without an anti-derivative is 2. All terms are <= n^2, with equality only when n is prime. In fact a(n) = n^2 - k^2, where k is the least number such that both n-k and n+k are prime; k = A047160(n). It appears that the anti-derivatives of even numbers are overwhelmingly semiprimes of the form n^2 - k^2. For example, 1000 has 28 anti-derivatives, all of this form. Sequence A189763 lists the even numbers that have anti-derivatives not of this form. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 27 2011"], "link": ["T. D.
