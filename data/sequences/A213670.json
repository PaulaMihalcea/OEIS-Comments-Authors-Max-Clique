For example, for the path P_3 = abc we have Q(P_3;x,y) = 1 + xy + xy + xy + x^2*y^2 + yx^2 + yx^2 + y*x^3, the terms corresponding to the vertex subsets empty, a, b, c, ac, ab, bc, and abc, respectively. For a rooted tree T, instead of Q(T;x,y) we shall write Q(n), where n is the Matula-Goebel number of T. We break up Q(n) into Q'(n) and Q\"(n), referring to vertex subsets containing and not containing the root, respectively. Obviously, Q(n) = Q'(n) + Q\"(n).  We have Q'(1)=xy, Q\"(1)=1; Q'(t-th prime) = xQ'(t) + xyQ\"(t), Q\"(t-th prime) = Q'(t) + Q\"(t); if n=rs (r,s>=2), then Q'(n) = Q'(r)Q'(s)/(xy), Q\"(n) = Q\"(r)Q\"(s) (see Theorem 25 in the Tittmann et al. reference).
