Similar polynomials are treated in Serre's paper. The discriminant of the polynomial is -563 and 563 is the only prime for which the polynomial has 3 distinct zeros. The primes p yielding 4 distinct zeros, A106280, correspond to the periods of the sequences A000078(k) mod p and A073817(k) mod p having length less than p. The Lucas 4-step sequence mod p has one additional prime p for which the period is less than p: the discriminant 563. For this prime, the Fibonacci 4-step sequence mod p has a period of p(p-1)."], "link": ["J.-P.
