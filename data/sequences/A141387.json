Harter, Klee, Schwinger). The triangle terms T(n,k)=T(2j,j+m) satisfy:(1/4)T(2j,j+m) = <j,m|J_1^2|j,m>  = <j,m|J_2^2|j,m>. Matrices for J_1^2 and J_2^2 are sparse. These diagonal equalities and the off-diagonal equalities of A268759 determine the only nonzero entries. Comments on A268759 provide a conjecture for the clear interpretation of these numbers in the context of binomial coefficients and other geometrical sequences. - _Bradley Klee_, Feb 20 2016", "This sequence appears in the probability of the coin tossing \"Gambler's Ruin\". Call the probability of winning a coin toss = p, and the probability of losing the toss is (1-p) = q,  and call z = q/p. A gambler starts with $1, and tosses for $1 stakes till he has $0 (ruin) or has $n (Wins). The average time Twinlose(n) of a game (win OR lose) is a well known function of z and n. The probabiltiy of the gambler winning Pwin(n) is also known, and is equal to (1-z)/(1-z^n). Twin(n) defined as the average time it takes the gambler to win such a game is not so well known (I have not found it in the literature). I calculated Twin(n) and found it to be Twin(n) = Pwin(n) * (the sum of T(n,m) * z^m  for m=0 to m=n) where T(n,m) is the given by the n-th row of this sequence. - _Steve Newman_, Oct 24 2016"], "reference": ["R.
