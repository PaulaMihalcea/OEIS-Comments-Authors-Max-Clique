To get gpf(N) >= 5, use the other side of the inequality, e_p <= 2*[log_p P'] with P = 3, P' = 5: This gives e_2 <= 4; e_3, e_5 <= 2; e_p = 0 for p > 5. Thus all N = a(n) > 2^4*3^2*5^2 = 3600 must have gpf(N) > 3, i.e., gpf(N) >= 5. This implies e_2 >= 2 and e_3 >= 1 and also e_5 >= 1, so we have 12 | N and 60 | N for all N = A002182(k) > 3600. The terms between 12 (resp. 60) and 3600 are also multiples of 12 (resp. 60), which completes the proof. - _M. F.
