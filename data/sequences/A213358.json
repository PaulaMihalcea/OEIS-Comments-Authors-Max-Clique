That's why Benoit Cloitre, author of A113560, takes vecmax, the max of all these quotients, in order to capture the large rate of growth of these quotients.  It would be better, in order to emphasize the largeness of these big quotients, to somehow quantify the ratio between the max and the average of all the quotients, or the average of all the others.", "Since Cloitre found a Fibonacci-like behavior of the vecmax, I thought to replace the power 5 by the power n, thus getting the sequence vecmax(contfrac(F(n+1)^n/F(n)^n)) instead of vecmax(contfrac(F(n+1)^5/F(n)^5)). After I noticed its behavior was almost that of the Lucas sequence, I took the sequence which subtracted the almost-Lucas sequence from it, thus eventually getting 0 after the 20th term."], "link": ["G.
