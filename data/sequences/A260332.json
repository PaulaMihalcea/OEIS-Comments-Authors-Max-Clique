In the Hasse diagram for such a poset, we have a least element, two elements in the level above, and one element in the top level, so the diagram resembles a diamond.  The associated permutation is the permutation obtained by reading the labels of each poset by levels left to right, starting with the least element.", "Also the number of labelings of n diamond-shaped posets with 4 vertices per diamond where the labels follow the poset relations whose associated reading permutation avoids 312 in the classical sense via reverse complement Wilf equivalence.", "Conjecture: Also the number of lattice paths (Schroeder paths) from (0,0) to (n,4n) with unit steps N=(0,1), E=(1,0) and D=(1,1) staying weakly above the line y = 4x. - _Michael D.
