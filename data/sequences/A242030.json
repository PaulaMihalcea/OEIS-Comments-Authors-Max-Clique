The iterative step is divide by 2 and add 1 if even, or multiply by 3 and subtract 1 if odd.", "This is one of a subset of Collatz-like variations with parameters a = 1 and b = (any positive or negative odd integer). The halting value h for type (a=1, b:odd) is given by h = 6 + b + 1. Any odd halting value can be chosen by selecting the appropriate value for b. The iterative function for subset type (a=1, b:odd) is x -> (x/2+ceiling(b/2)) if x is even or x -> (3*x-2*b+1) if x is odd. Unlike the other subsets, there is no simple relationship between the row lengths and the Collatz sequence row lengths.", "Two variations belong to the same subset if their (a) parameters are the same and their (b) parameters have the same parity. It is conjectured that any variations belonging to the same subset have equal row lengths.", "The subset is part of a wider class of Collatz variations uniquely identified by two parameters (a,b) where a or b can be any integer. The general formula for the halting value is h = 6^(b mod 2)*a + b + b mod 2; the general formula for the iterative mapping function is x -> (x/2 + ceiling(b/2)) if x is even and x -> (3*x - 2*b + a^(a mod 2)) if x is odd.
