A221646), or as 3, 1, considering twice the first one.", "Contrary to the original look-and-say, this sequence is not base dependent, because figures or group of figures are not aggregated and read as numbers.", "The sequence is determined by pairs. Terms of even ranks are counts while odd ranks are numbers.", "As in the original look-and-say sequence, a(n) is always equal to 1, 2 or 3. The subsequence 3,3,3 never appears.", "Two successive odd ranks cannot be equal, which implies that sequences of length three always begin on even rank and that two such sequences never follow each other.", "Applying the look-and-say principle to the sequence itself, it is simply shift three ranks to the left.", "With seed 2 (resp. 3), the sequence is A088203 (resp. A088204). These two sequences are shifted one rank left by the look-and-say transform.", "With seed 2, the sequence A088203 is the concatenation of A006751 (original look-and-say method by blocks): this is because all blocks begin with 1 or 3 and end with 2 and therefore, there is no possible interaction between blocks after concatenation."], "link": ["J.-C.
