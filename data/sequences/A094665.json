As usual eta(m) = (1-2^(1-m))*zeta(m) with eta(m) the Dirichlet eta function and zeta(m) the Riemann zeta function. It is well-known that ES1[1-2*m,n=1] = (4^m-1)*(-bernoulli(2*m))/m for m >= 1. and together with the recurrence relation this leads to ES1[-1,n] = 0.5 for n >= 1.", "We discovered that the n-th term of the row coefficients ES1[1-2*m,n] for m >= 1, can be generated with the rather simple polynomials RES1(1-2*m,n) = (-1)^(m+1)*ECGP(1-2*m, n)/2^m. This discovery was enabled by the recurrence relation for the RES1(1-2*m,n) which we derived from the recurrence relation for the ES1[2*m-1,n] coefficients and the fact that RES1(-1,n) = 0.5. The coefficients of the ECGP(1-2*m,n) polynomials led to this triangle and subsequently to triangle A083061.
