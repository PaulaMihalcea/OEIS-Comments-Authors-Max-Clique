To be precise, identify i=1,2,...,2*n+1 with the odd representatives J=1,3,...,4*n+1 of this set, via the map J = 2*i-1. It is not hard to show that the induced permutation on the set of J values is given on integer representatives by J -> (4*n+3+J)/2 if i=(J+1)/2 is even and J -> (4*n+3-J)/2 if i=(J+1)/2 is odd. It follows that this induces the permutation J -> +-J/2 (mod 4*n+3), from which we immediately see that the order is as stated.", "Note that the order of 2 acting on (Z/(4n+3)Z)/{+-1} is the same as the order of either 2 or -2 acting on (Z/(4n+3)Z), depending on which of these is a quadratic residue modulo 4n+3.
