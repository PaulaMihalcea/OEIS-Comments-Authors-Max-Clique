Given this geometric relationship, it is considered worth looking for qualities that A270877 may have in common with the sequence of primes, potentially influenced by related causes such as the effect of prime factors on A270877.", "The columns of this sequence, listing the runs of m consecutive integers within A270877, merit comparative examination with equivalent sequences for prime k-tuples. For m=5, the notably larger ratio between T(1,5) and T(2,5) resembles early large ratio gaps in the occurrence sequences of k-tuples such as A022008 (sextuples), whereas columns m<5 are more comparable with those for shorter k-tuples such as A001359 (twin primes) and A007530 (quadruples), each having a relatively low-valued first term (less than 60) and without such a large ratio gap. In comparison, the columns for runs m>5 appear more like the sequences for some longer k-tuples such as A027570 (a 10-tuple sequence).
