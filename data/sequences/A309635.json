This notion is considered in the subject of symmetry breaking of simple (finite or infinite) graphs. A distinguishing coloring partition of a graph G is a partition of the vertices of G such that it induces a distinguishing coloring for G. We say two distinguishing coloring partitions P1 and P2 of G are equivalent if there is a nontrivial automorphism of G which maps P1 onto P2. Given a graph G, we use the notation Psi_k(G) to denote the number of non-equivalent distinguishing coloring partitions of G with at most k parts. This sequence gives A(n,k) = Psi_k(P_n), i.e., the number of non-equivalent distinguishing coloring partitions of the path P_n on n vertices with at most k parts.", "Note that, for any graph G, Psi_k(G) = Sum_{i<=k} psi_i(G), where psi_i(G) is the number of non-equivalent distinguishing coloring partitions of G with exactly i parts.
