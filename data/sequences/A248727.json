In particular, umbrally [a.(0;t)+b.(0;t)]^n vanishes except for n=0 for which it's unity, implying the two sets of Appell polynomials formed from the two bases, a_n(z;t) = (a.(0;t)+z)^n and b_n(z;t) = (b.(0;t) + z)^n, are an umbral compositional inverse pair, i.e., b_n(a.(x;t);t)= x^n = a_n(b.(x;t);t). Raising operators for these Appell polynomials are related to the polynomials of A028246, whose reverse polynomials are given by A123125 * A007318.
