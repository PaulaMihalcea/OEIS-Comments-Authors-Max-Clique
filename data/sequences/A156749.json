All the even powers (included in the squares) map congruences {-1, +1} to {+1, +1} respectively and so contribute to the bias, whereas all the odd powers map {-1, +1} to {-1, +1} respectively and so do not contribute to the bias.", "One would then expect the ratio of this bias, if caused exclusively by the even powers, relative to the number of primes in either congruences to asymptotically tend towards to 0 as k(n) increases (since 1/(4*sqrt(k(n))) is o(1/(phi(4)*log(k(n)))).", "The persistence or not of such bias in absolute value then does not contradict The Prime Number Theorem for Arithmetic Progressions (Dirichlet) which states that the asymptotic (relative) ratio of the count of prime numbers in each congruence class coprime to m tends to 1 in the limit towards infinity. (Cf. 'Prime Number Races' link below.)", "Also, even if this bias grows in absolute value, it is expected to be drowned out (albeit very slowly) by the increasing fluctuations in the number of primes in each congruence classes coprime to 4 since, assuming the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis, their maximum amplitude would be, with x standing for k(n) in our case, h(x) = O(sqrt(x)*log(x)) <= C*sqrt(x)*log(x) in absolute value which gives relative fluctuations of order h(x)/x = O(log(x)/sqrt(x)) <= C*log(x)/sqrt(x) in the densities of primes pi(x, {4, 1})/x and pi(x, {4, 3})/x in either congruence classes.", "Since 1/(4*sqrt(x)) is o(log(x)/sqrt(x)) the bias will eventually be overwhelmed by the \"pink noise or nearly 1/f noise\" corresponding to the fluctuations in the prime densities in either congruence classes. The falsehood of the Riemann Hypothesis would imply even greater fluctuations since the RH corresponds to the minimal h(x).", "We get pink noise or nearly 1/f noise if we consider the prime density fluctuations of pi(x, {4, k})/x as an amplitude spectrum over x (with a power density spectrum of (C*log(x)/sqrt(x))^2 = ((C*log(x))^2)/x and see x as the frequency f. This power density spectrum is then nearly 1/x and would have nearly equal energy (although slowly increasing as (C*log(x))^2) for each octave of x. (Cf.
