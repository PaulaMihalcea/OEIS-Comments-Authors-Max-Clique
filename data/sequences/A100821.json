This sequence can be derived from the sequence b(n)=1 iff n and n+2 are both prime, else b(n)=0. This latter sequence has as its inverse Moebius transform the sequence c(n) = the number of distinct factors of n which are the smaller of a pair of twin primes. For example, c(15)=2 because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5, each of which is the smaller of a pair of twin primes. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jan 07 2005"], "formula": ["a(n) = A062301(n+1) = 1 - A100810(n)."], "mathematica": ["Table[If[Prime[n] + 2 == Prime[n + 1], 1, 0], {n, 120}] (* _Ray Chandler_, Jan 09 2005 *)"], "keyword": "easy,nonn", "offset": "1,1", "author": "_Giovanni Teofilatto_, Jan 06 2005", "ext": ["Corrected and extended by _Ray Chandler_, Jan 09 2005"], "references": 3, "revision": 8, "time": "2019-11-01T16:43:31-04:00", "created": "2005-02-20T03:00:00-05:00"}]}
