Perhaps the ambiguity may not arise. E.g., row 6 is 4,6,9,10,15,25. This row cannot be extended to get the next row without bringing in another prime because every number divisible by 2,3 or 5 will be a multiple of one of the previous terms. Hence in row 7, prime 7 has to be brought in and then we get a new set of numbers: 4,6,9,10,14,15,21."], "xref": ["Cf. A002024.", "Cf.
