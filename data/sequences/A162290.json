Devaraj conjectured that a(n) is always an integer, and this was proved by Carl Pomerance.", "a(n) may be called the Pomerance index of the n-th 3-Carmichael number.", "An application of Pomerance index: The index for the Carmichael number 561 is 7. This can be used to prove that 561 is the only 3-factor Carmichael number with 3 as one of its factors. Proof: Let N be a 3-factor composite number. Keep 3 fixed and increase the other two prime factors indefinitely. The relevant Pomerance index is a number less than 7 but greater than 6. As the other two prime factors are increased indefinitely the Pomerance index becomes asymptotic to 6. Hence 561 is the only 3-factor Carmichael number with 3 as a factor. - _A.K.
