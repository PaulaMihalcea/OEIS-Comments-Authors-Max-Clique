The corresponding pattern has T(n,k) dots in its longest side, k dots in the two adjacent sides and T(n,k)-k+1 dots in the fourth side (where a count of 1 dot may be understood as signifying that side's absence).", "Reason: From the definition, for k >= 1, m >= 0, T(A000217(k)+km,k) = k+m, where A000217(k) = k(k+1)/2, the k-th triangular number. First element of column k is T(A000217(k),k) = k: this matches a triangular pattern of A000217(k) dots with 3 sides of k dots. Looking at this pattern as k rows of 1..k dots, extend each row by m dots to create a trapezoidal pattern of A000217(k)+km dots with a longest side of k+m dots and adjacent sides of k dots: this matches T(A000217(k)+km,k) = k+m. As nonzero elements in column k occur at intervals of k, every nonzero T(n,k) has a match. Every trapezoidal pattern can be produced by extending a triangular pattern as described, so they all have a match.", "The truth of conjecture 1 follows, since each nonzero T(n,k) = k+m corresponds to a trapezoidal pattern of n dots having k rows with lengths (1+m)..(k+m).", "The A270877 sieve is related to this sequence because it eliminates n if it is the sum of consecutive numbers whose largest term has survived the sifting (which may likewise be seen in terms of a trapezoidal dot pattern and its longest side).
