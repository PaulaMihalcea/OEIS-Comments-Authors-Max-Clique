It is easy to see that the total number of 2-intersections N2 is 3*(n-1)^2 (which includes every 3-intersection as two 2-intersections) by symmetry. But we are interested in excluding the concurrency of more than 2. By Ceva's theorem necessary and sufficient condition for 3 concurrent segments that connect the edges with the opposite side, the number of 3-intersections N3 is the same as the number of (i,j,k) belonging to [1,n-1]x[1,n-1]x[1,n-1] such that (i/(n-i))*(j/(n-j))*(k/(n-k))=1.
