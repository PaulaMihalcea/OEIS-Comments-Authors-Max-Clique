Neither the order of the squares nor the signs of the numbers to be squared are taken into account. a(n) = 0  if no such representation exists. Checked for n = 3,4, ..., 1000 (using the program below). The two squares are in each case nonzero and distinct. If one includes also 0 as a square in the primitive sum of two squares one could take a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1. If only nonzero squares are considered, then one could take a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1.", "For the numbers n with a(n) > 0 (in this conjectured interpretation of a(n)) see A008784. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 17 2013", "The stated conjecture is true because it follows immediately from Theorem 3.22, p. 165, of the Niven-Zuckerman-Montgomery reference. There r(n) gives the number of primitive solutions of n = x^2 + y^2 with ordered and signed pairs of integers x,y. Because x and y are distinct if n >= 3 one needs here a(n) = r(n)/2^3. This then coincides with the formula for u(n) given in the Gr\u00fcnbaum-Shephard Theorem 5. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 18 2013", "The equality noted by _R. J. Mathar_ above indeed holds for all n > 2. Regarding n = 2 case: if we consider periodic twills as satins (which seems more consistent), we'll get a(2) = 1 from the plain weave; otherwise (following Gr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard), a(1) = a(2) = 0 (so we get A157228). In the former case, the all-black pattern can formally be counted as a(1) = 1, but physically it is dubious (this pattern corresponds to unweaved warp and weft). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 09 2018"], "reference": ["Ivan Niven, Herbert S.
