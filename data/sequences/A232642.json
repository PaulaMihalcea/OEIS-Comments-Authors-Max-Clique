Then S is the set of positive integers, which arise in generations. Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,4), g(3) = (3,6,5,10), etc. Concatenating these gives A232642, a permutation of the positive integers. For n > 1, the number of numbers in g(n) is 2*F(n+1), where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers. It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes, an edge from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 2*x + 2 if 2*x + 2 has not already occurred.", "Seen as triangle read by rows: A082560 with duplicates removed. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 14 2015"], "link": ["Clark Kimberling and Reinhard Zumkeller, <a href=\"/A232642/b232642.txt\">Rows n = 1..17 of triangle, flattened</a>, first 13 rows from Clark Kimberling", "<a href=\"/index/Per#IntegerPermutation\">Index entries for sequences that are permutations of the natural numbers</a>"], "example": ["Each x begets x + 1 and 2*x + 2, but if either has already occurred it is deleted.
