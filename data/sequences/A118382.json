There is one primitive sequence whose values sum to each odd m; all other sequences can be obtained by repeating and refining these. Refining means splitting one or more terms into values summing to that term. The Orloj clock sequence is the one summing to 15: 1,2,3,4,3,2, with a beautiful up and down pattern.", "These are known in some papers as Sindel sequences.
