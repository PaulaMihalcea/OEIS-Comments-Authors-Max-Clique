The largest part of the j-th region of n is A141285(j) and the number of parts is h = A194446(j).", "Some properties of the regions of n:", "- The number of regions of n equals the number of partitions of n (see A000041).", "- The set of regions of n contain the sets of regions of all positive integers previous to n.", "- The first j regions of n are also first j regions of all integers greater than n.", "- The sums of all largest parts of all regions of n equals the total number of parts of all regions of n.

Then we draw a vertical line {[0, 0],[0, p(n)]} of length p(n) where p(n) is the number of partitions of n. Then, for j = 1..p(n), we draw a horizontal line {[0, j],[g, j] where g = A141285(j) is the largest part of the j-th partition of n, with the list of partitions in lexicographic order. Then, for n = 1 .. p(n), we draw a vertical line from the point [g,j] up to intercept the next segment in a lower row with respect to the axis \"y\". So we have a number of closed regions. Then we divide each region of n in horizontal rectangles with shorter sides = 1. We can see that in the original rectangle of area n*p(n) each row contains a set of rectangles whose areas are equal to the parts of one of the partitions of n. Then each region of n is labeled according to the position of its largest part on axis \"y\". Note that each region of n is similar to a mirror version of the Young diagram of one of the partitions of s, where s is the sum of all parts of the region. See the illustrations of the seven regions of 5 in the Links section.", "Note that if row j of triangle contains parts of size 1 then the parts of row j are the smallest parts of all partitions of T(j,1), (see A046746), and also T(j,1) is a record in the sequence and also j is the number of partitions of T(j,1), (see A000041). Otherwise, if row j does not contain parts of size 1 then the parts of row j are the emergent parts of the next record in the sequence (see A183152). Row j is also the partition of A186412(j).", "Also triangle read by rows in which row r lists the parts of the last section of the set of partitions of r, ordered by regions, such that the previous parts to the part of size r are the emergent parts of the partitions of r (see A138152) and the rest are the smallest parts of the partitions of r (see example). - _Omar E.
