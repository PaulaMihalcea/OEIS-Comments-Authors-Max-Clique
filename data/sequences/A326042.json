If true, then there are no odd perfect numbers. This condition is equivalent to the condition that if A161942 has no fixed points larger than one, then there are no odd perfect numbers. This follows as whenever k is a fixed point, that is, a(k) = k, then we should also have A003961(a(k)) = A003961(A064989(sigma(A003961(k)))) = A161942(A003961(k)) = A003961(k). Note that A003961 is an injective and surjective mapping from natural numbers to odd numbers, A064989 is its (left) inverse, and composition A003961(A064989(n)) is equivalent to A000265(n).", "From _Antti Karttunen_, Aug 05 2020: (Start)", "For any hypothetical odd perfect number x, we would have A003973(k) = 2 * A003961(k), with k = A064989(x) and x = A003961(k).

On the other hand, A003973(k) = sigma(A003961(k)) < A003961(A003961(k)) [see A286385 for the reason why], so a necessary condition for this is that x should be one of the terms of A246282.
