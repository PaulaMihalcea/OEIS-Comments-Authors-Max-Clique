There is one unrefined sequence whose values sum to each n; all other Orloj clock sequences summing to n can be obtained by refining this one. Refining means splitting one or more terms into values summing to that term. (The unrefined sequence for n = 2^k*(2m-1) is the sequence for 2m-1 repeated 2^k times, but any single refinement - possible unless m = 1 - will produce an aperiodic sequence summing to n.) The Orloj clock sequence is the one summing to 15: 1,2,3,4,3,2, with a beautiful up and down pattern."], "link": ["Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_astronomical_clock\">Prague astronomical clock</a>"], "formula": ["Let b(i),0<=i<k be all the residues of triangular numbers modulo n in order, with b(k)=n.
