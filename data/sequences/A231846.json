Let Omega(t) = xi(1/2 + i*t)/xi(1/2) where xi is the Landau version of the Riemann xi function, t is real, and i^2 = -1. The Taylor series coefficients vanish for odd order derivatives and, for even, are c_(2n) = Omega^(2n)(0) = (-1)^n * xi^(2n)(1/2) / xi(1/2) = A001147(n) * P_n as in the Example section with F^(2n) = -2 * Sum(1/x_k^(2n)) = -2 * Tr_(2n) where x_k is the imaginary part of the k-th zero of the Riemann zeta function and k ranges over all the zeros above the real axis. E.g., (see the Math Stack Exchange question) summing over the first several thousands of zeros, c_4 = A001147(2)*P_2 = 3*[2*(-2*Tr_4) + (-2*Tr_2)^2] = 12*[-(0.000372) + (0.02311)^2] = .005962 and c_4 = xi^(4)*(1/2)/xi(1/2) = 0.002963/0.497 = 0.005962 (rounding off). Conversely, the Tr_(2n) can be calculated from the c_n using the Faber polynomials (A263916), as indicated in A036039. See Coffey for Taylor coefficients of Omega(t) about t = 0 and the MSE question for Tr_(2n). The traces are convergent and any zeros in the critical strip off the critical line would have a slightly more complicated real contribution to the traces but negligible to any practical order. - _Tom Copeland_, May 27 2020"], "xref": ["Cf.
