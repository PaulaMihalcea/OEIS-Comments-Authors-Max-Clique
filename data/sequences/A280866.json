J. A. Sloane_, Jan 14 2017: (Start)", "Theorem: This is a permutation of the natural numbers.", "Proof. 1. By construction no term is repeated.", "2. The sequence is clearly infinite, since we can always use a very large prime to build the next term.", "3. So for any integer m, either it appears in the sequence, or there is an n_0 such that for n > n_0, a(n) > m.", "4. For any prime p, there is a term a(n) that is divisible by p. For if not, no prime greater than p can appear either, or we could have used p instead. This means all terms are products of the primes less than p. Go out a long way in the sequence until the terms exceed p!. Then one of the finite set of numbers p times {a possibly empty product of distinct primes less than p} will be a smaller candidate for the next term. So p will appear. Contradiction.", "5. Call a(n) free if all its prime factors already appeared in a(n-1). If a(n) is free then there are no constraints on a(n+1) and so a(n+1) will be the smallest number not yet in the sequence.", "6. For a prime p, let a(n) be the first term divisible by p. Either a(n) = k*p, where k is a product of the distinct primes needed to link a(n) to a(n-1), in which case a(n+1) = p and is free; or else a(n) = p, in which case a(n-1) was free. So in either case there is a free term associated with each prime. (Except if there are two consecutive primes, like 13 and 17, when we only get one free term, not two. We will ignore this complication! There cannot be three consecutive primes.)", "7. Since there are infinitely many primes, the sequence contains infinitely many free terms, and so every number will eventually appear. For suppose k never appears. Consider the first free term a(n) > k. Then a(n+1) = k, a contradiction.
