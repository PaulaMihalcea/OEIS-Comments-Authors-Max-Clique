This sequence b, when n > 2, occurs as the number of congruent regular n-gons in various ways of making cycles of them by sticking them together along edges with constant rotation angle between the two stickings on any one n-gon. For example, it is well known that only the triangle, square and hexagon can make cycles going once around a common point. But allowing the n-gons to keep going any number of times around the common corner, they will eventually close up into a cycle for any n (since their corner interior angle is a rational multiple of Pi), and the number of n-gons in that cycle is b(n). - _David Pasino_, Nov 12 2017", "Here is another example of b(n) in the behavior of regular polygons as said in the comment of Nov 12 2017. For integers n and k, both exceeding 2, consider congruent regular k-gon tiles arranged as a ring going once around a central region, each tile adjacent to two others by sharing an exact edge, such that, if possible for n and k, the centers of the k-gons are the vertices of a regular n-gon. Then for any given n, the numbers k for which this arrangement is possible are exactly the multiples of b(n). (In the cases where (n, k) is (3, 6) or (4, 4) or (6, 3), the central region is only a point.) - _David Pasino_, Feb 20 2018", "The generating function of the rationals A060819(n)/a(n) = 1/2 - 1/(n+2), n >= 0, with A060819(0) = 0, mentioned in the comment on a sum by _Gary Detlefs_ above is (1/2)*(1-hypergeom([1, 1], [3], -x/(1-x)))/(1-x) = (x*(2 - x) + 2*(1 - x)*log(1-x) )/(2*(1-x)*x^2).
