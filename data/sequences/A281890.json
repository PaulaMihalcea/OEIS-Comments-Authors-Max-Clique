Except for 1, which lacks prime factors, column 1 has the row heading's least prime factor, column 2 has a value for composite numbers but is blank for primes, and so on. This sequence measures precisely how frequently the various primes occur in each column. This is possible because any given prime occurs cyclically in any given column, for the reason following.", "The occurrence pattern of up to k factors of prime(n) in such prime factorizations has a fundamental period over the positive integers of prime(n)^k. The least common period for up to k factors of each of the first n primes is Primorial(n)^k, and this covers everything that can affect the occurrence of prime(n) in the least k factors.
