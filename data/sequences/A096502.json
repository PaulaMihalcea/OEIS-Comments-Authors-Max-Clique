W. Wilson observes, this is similar to the Riesel/Sierpinski problem and there is e.g. no prime of the form 2^k - 777149, which is divisible by 3,5,7,13,19,37 or 73 if k is in 1+2Z, 2+4Z, 4+12Z, 8+12Z, 12+36Z, 0+36Z resp. 24+36Z. Already for n=935 it is difficult to find a solution. Is this linked to the fact that 2n+1=1871 is member of a prime quadruple (A007530) and quintuple (A022007)? - _M. F.
