The entries T(n,k) of the present table satisfy T(n,k) = A122193(n,k) + A122193(n,k+1). Proof. In an arrangement contributing to T(n,k) either the intervals are all nondegenerate, and there are A122193(n,k) arrangements of this type, or at least one of the intervals in the arrangement is degenerate. The following argument to show there are A122193(n,k+1) arrangements of the latter type is taken from the solution to the problem posed in the 'IBM Ponder This' link.", "In an arrangement of n nondegenerate finite closed intervals having k+1 distinct endpoints, the rightmost point is the right endpoint of one or more intervals. If we move each of these right endpoints to coincide with their corresponding left endpoint then we obtain an arrangement of n finite closed intervals with k distinct endpoints, where at least one of the intervals has zero length. The reverse mapping is clear: given an arrangement of n finite closed intervals with k distinct endpoints, where at least one of the intervals has zero length, take each interval of zero length and move all the right endpoints of these degenerate intervals to a single new rightmost point. This produces an arrangement of n nondegenerate finite closed intervals having k+1 distinct endpoints.
