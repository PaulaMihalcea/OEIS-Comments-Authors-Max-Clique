This notion is considered in the subject of symmetry breaking of simple (finite or infinite) graphs. A distinguishing coloring partition of a graph G is a partition of the vertices of G such that it induces a distinguishing coloring for G. We say two distinguishing coloring partitions P1 and P2 of G are equivalent if there is a nontrivial automorphism of G which maps P1 onto P2. Given a graph G, we use the notation psi_k(G) to denote the number of non-equivalent distinguishing coloring partitions of G with at exactly k parts. For n>=1, this sequence gives T(n,k) = psi_k(P_n), i.e., the number of non-equivalent distinguishing coloring partitions of the path P_n on n vertices with exactly k parts.", "Also, for n > 1 the number of reversible string structures of length n using exactly k different symbols that are not equivalent to their reversal (compare A284949). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Aug 15 2019"], "link": ["Andrew Howroyd, <a href=\"/A309748/b309748.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1275</a>", "B.
