For suppose n is perfect. n != 9 (since 9 is 9's only divisor). Then 9|n and 9 != n, so sum (d : d|n, d!=n) ends in 9 and thus so does n. But 9ish numbers are not divisible by any single digit < 9. Thus n has no divisors of the same length as n, other than n itself. So sum (d : d|n, d!=n) is one digit shorter than n."], "link": ["D.
