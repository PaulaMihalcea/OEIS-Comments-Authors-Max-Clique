Notice that there is exactly one point where we can cut this permutation into two consecutive pieces in such a way that no item is permuted from one piece to the other, namely (3,1,2 | 5,4). This \"cut\" has the property that all the indices to its left are less than all the indices to its right. There are no other such cut-points: (3,1 | 2,5,4) doesn't work, for example, because 3 > 2.", "Stanley defines the \"connectivity set\" as the set of positions at which you can make such a cut.
