Consider the southeast border of the Ferrers board of the integer partition and consider the binary number obtained by replacing each east step with 1 and each north step, except the last one, with 0. The corresponding decimal form is, by definition, the viabin number of the given integer partition. \"Viabin\" is coined from \"via binary\". For example, consider the integer partition [2,2,2,1]. The southeast border of its Ferrers board yields 10100, leading to the viabin number 20.", "From _Omar E.
