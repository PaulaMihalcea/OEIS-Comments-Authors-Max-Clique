The value of f has a trivial lower bound of 0, and an upper bound which is this constant. It is achieved iff the cylinder diameter is sqrt(2) times its height, and the sphere is circumscribed to it. A similar constant can be associated with any n-dimensional geometric shape. For 3D cuboids it is A165952. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Mar 07 2016", "The ratio between the thickness and diameter of a dynamically fair coin having an equal probability, 1/3, of landing on each of its two faces and on its side after being tossed in the air.
