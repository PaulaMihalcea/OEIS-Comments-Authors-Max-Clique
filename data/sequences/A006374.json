Usually this is F = [a,2*b,c] with discriminant Disc = 4*(b^2 - a*c) = 4*Delta. A definite form is reduced if 2*|b| <= a <= c, and if any of the inequalities reduces to an equality then b >= 0 (HK, p. 179). The positive definite case has a > 0 and c  > 0. Here the forms F do not need to satisfy gcd(a,2*b,c) = 1. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 31 2019"], "reference": ["J. H. Conway and N. J. A.
