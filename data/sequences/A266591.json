The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude. This sequence is periodic with a pre-period of length 2 (namely 1, 1) and a period of length 2 (namely 1, 0). It can be shown (via induction) that the middle column of rule 37 is eventually periodic, too. - _Valerie Roitner_, Apr 02 2020"], "reference": ["S.
