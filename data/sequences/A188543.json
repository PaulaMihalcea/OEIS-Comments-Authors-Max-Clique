Its angles are B, t*B and pi-B-t*B, where t is the silver ratio, 1+sqrt(2), at A014176. \"Side-silver\" and \"angle-silver\" refer to partitionings of ABC, each in a manner that matches the continued fraction [2,2,2,...] of t.

For the side partitioning and angle partitioning (i,e, constructions in which 2 triangles are removed at each stage, analogous to the removal of 1 square at each stage of the partitioning of the golden rectangle into squares) which match arbitrary continued fractions (of sidelength ratios and angle ratios), see the 2007 reference."], "link": ["Clark Kimberling, <a href=\"http://www.heldermann.de/JGG/JGG11/JGG112/jgg11014.htm\">Two kinds of golden triangles, generalized to match continued fractions</a>, Journal for Geometry and Graphics, 11 (2007) 165-171."], "formula": ["B is the number in [0,Pi] such that sin(B*t^2)=t*sin(B), where t=1+sqrt(2), the silver ratio."], "example": ["B=0.4235466615478147887414222095779154 approximately.", "B=24.2674 degrees approximately."], "mathematica": ["r = 1+2^(1/2); Clear[t]; RealDigits[FindRoot[Sin[r*t + t] == r*Sin[t], {t, 1}, WorkingPrecision -> 120][[1, 2]]][[1]]"], "xref": ["Cf.
