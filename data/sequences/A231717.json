This works because at the positions given by each x=A226061(n+1), it holds that A219666(x) = (n+1)!-1, which has a factorial base representation (A007623) of (n,n-1,n-2,...,3,2,1) whose digit sum (A034968) is the n-th triangular number, A000217(n). This in turn is always a new record as at those points, in each significant digit position so far employed, a maximal digit value (for factorial number system) is used, and thus the preceding term, A219666(x-1) cannot have any larger digits in its factorial base representation, and so the differences between their digits (in matching positions) are all nonnegative."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A231717/b231717.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..3149</a>"], "formula": ["a(0)=0, and for n>=1, a(n) = A231713(A219666(n),A219666(n-1))."], "program": ["(Scheme)", "(define (A231717 n) (if (zero? n) n (A231713bi (A219666 n) (A219666 (- n 1)))))"], "xref": ["A231718 gives the positions of ones.", "Cf. also A230410, A231719, A232095."], "keyword": "nonn", "offset": "0,3", "author": "_Antti Karttunen_, Nov 12 2013", "references": 7, "revision": 12, "time": "2013-11-23T19:47:58-05:00", "created": "2013-11-23T19:47:58-05:00"}]}
