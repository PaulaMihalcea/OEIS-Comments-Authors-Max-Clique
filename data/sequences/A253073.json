Then since none of the terms Y, 2Y, 3Y, ..., 2qY appear, it must be that, eventually, every term in the sequence is of the form PRIME - Y and also of the form PRIME - 2Y and also of the form PRIME - 3Y, ... and also of the form PRIME - 2qY.", "That means we have a prime p and a number Y such that p, p+Y, p+2Y, p + 3Y, p+4Y, ..., p+2qY are all prime. But take this sequence mod q. Since q does not divide Y, the terms 0, Y, ..., 2qY cover every residue class mod q twice. Therefore, p + kY covers each residue class mod q twice. Consequently, there are two terms congruent to 0 mod q. One can be q, but the other must be a multiple of it (contradicting its primality)."], "link": ["Reinhard Zumkeller, <a href=\"/A253073/b253073.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>"], "program": ["(Haskell)", "a253073 n = a253073_list !!
