The sub-maximal digit slope is occupied when there is at least one nonzero digit k in a digit-position k+1. The sub-sub-maximal slope is occupied when there is at least one nonzero digit k in a digit-position k+2, etc. This sequence gives the number of nonzero digits on a slope (of possibly several) for which there exists no other slopes with more nonzero digits. See the examples.", "In other words: a(n) gives the number of occurrences of a most common element in the multiset [(i_x - d_x) | where d_x ranges over each nonzero digit present in factorial base representation of n and i_x is that digit's position from the right].", "Involution A225901 maps this metric to another metric A264990 which gives the maximal number of equal nonzero digits occurring in factorial base representation (A007623) of n.
