This follows because of the two transitions x -> A005843(x) (doubling) and x -> A003961(x) (prime shift) used to generate descendants in A005940-tree, using A003961 at any step of the process will ruin the chances of encountering sigma(k) anywhere further down that subtree.", "Proof: Any left child in A005940 (i.e., A003961(k) for k) is larger than sigma(k), for any k > 2 [see A286385 for a proof], and A003961(n) > n for all n > 1. Thus, apart from A003961(2) = 3 = sigma(2), A003961^t(k) > sigma(k), where A003961^t means t-fold application of prime shift, here with t >= 1.
