Note that if the starting value of a trajectory in the Collatz sequence is not treated as a potential stopping value, then the conjecture would also be valid for n = 1.", "Starting with x the first step in this sequence is always to multiply by 3. Thereafter if x <> 6, divide by 2 (rounding up) if x mod 3 = 0, otherwise multiply by 3. If the initial multiply-by-3 step is omitted the sequence still arrives at 6 for any starting value (conjecturally), but the length of the trajectory would no longer be the same as the length of the Collatz trajectory for starting values (n>1) that are divisible by 3.", "While any odd number in the classic Collatz trajectory is immediately followed by an even number, trajectories in this sequence may contain a contiguous run of odd numbers.
