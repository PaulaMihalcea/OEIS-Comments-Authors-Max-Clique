Moreover, empirically: a(n) deviates from mu(initial-value) = mu(n) only if iv = n is an even squarefree number (i.e., it is from A039956). - This comment, like also the next one, concerns the original Collatz-related definition of this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Sep 18 2017", "From _Marc LeBrun_, Feb 19 2004: (Start)", "Absolute values are the same as those of A091069. First consider the descending parts of Collatz (or 3x+1) trajectories, those that begin with even numbers 2^p k, with k odd. These go 2^p*k, 2^(p-1)*k, ... 2k, k. All but 2k and k are divisible by 4, a (rational) square, hence their mu values are all 0 and so they contribute nothing to the sum.", "Then at the end, since mu(2k) = -mu(k), the last two steps cancel each other out. So every descending chain in a trajectory contributes 0. Of course the full trajectory of every even number consists entirely of descending chains, so A087003 is 0 for all even n.", "On the other hand, the trajectory of every odd number consists of just that number followed by the trajectory of an even number (which contributes nothing) so A087003 is indeed equal to mu(n) for odd n.", "(End)", "The sequence is multiplicative; it may be defined as the Dirichlet inverse of the integers modulo 2 (A000035). - _Gerard P.
