Areas divided by 6 of these triangles.", "comment": ["The problem is: given a square, find a positive integer that, whether added to or subtracted from that square, yields a square. That is, both x^2 + C = y^2 and x^2 - C = z^2. Equivalently: z^2 + C = x^2 and x^2 + C = y^2 (squares in arithmetic progression). This is treated in Fibonacci's 'The book of squares' (Liber Quadratorum (1225) but for rational x,y,z). See the Sigler reference, Proposition 14, pp. 53-74 (note that the formulation of this problem on p. 53 is not correct, 'from a square' should read 'from the same square'). See also van der Waerden, pp. 40-42, and A. Weil, pp. 13-14. The desired number C is called a congruum by Fibonacci (a congruous number in Sigler's translation).", "For the history of this problem, see Dickson, pp. 459-472 (he uses the (misleading) term congruent number).", "The following solution is based on primitive Pythagorean triangles. (Fibonacci's solution is based on sums of odd squares.) The triangle T(n, m) = 24*C(n, m) will have 0's for those (n, m) not leading to primitive Pythagorean triples.", "Addition of the two equations, substitution of y = u + v > 0 and z = |u - v| and division by 2 leads to x^2 = u^2 + v^2. Consider primitive Pythagorean triples (u, v, x) with even v which are pairwise relatively prime. Then also GCD(u,v,x) = 1. A common factor f for u, v and x would lead to a multiplication by f^2 on both sides of the two equations. For primitive Pythagorean triples see A249866. One has u = n^2 - m^2, v = 2*n*m and x = n^2 + m^2 with GCD(n, m) = 1 , n > m >= 1, n + m odd. Then C = C(n, m) = 4*n*m*(n^2 - m^2) = 2*v(n, m)*u(n, m). This is four times the area of the Pythagorean triangle. C is divisible by 4! = 24 (see A020885). Define T(n, m) = C(n, m)/4!, for 2 <= m + 1 <= n. This is the area of the corresponding primitive Pythagorean triangle divided by 6.", "The corresponding x = x(n, m), y = y(n, m) and z(n, m) number triangles are given in A222946, A225949 and A258149 respectively.", "T(n, m) = n*m*(n^2 - m^2)/6, for m = 1, 2, ..., n-1, has for n >= 2 the minimum value at m = 1, and the next largest value appears for n >= 3 at m = n-1. Note all (n, m) pairs are considered here. The proof of the first part is easy. The proof of T(n, m) - T(n, n-1) > 0, for m = 2, 3, ..., n-2, and n >= 3, is equivalent to n^2*(m-2) + 3*n > m^3 +1 and this is easy to prove with n >= m+2 and m >= 2. Therefore the triangle T(n, m) with 0's attains for even n the smallest nonzero row entry at m = 1, and for odd n the smallest nonzero row entry appears at m = n-1 (last entry).", "This allows us to find (after solution of two cubic equations for even and odd n, named ne = ne(N) and no = no(N)) a row number nmin(N) = max(ne(n), no(N)) such that N will not appear in any row n > nmin(N).", "The original problem posed to Fibonacci by Giovanni di Palermo (Master John of Palermo) was to find a [rational] square that when increased or decreased by 5 gives a square. Fibonacci gave the solution in his Liber Quadratorum in Proposition 17 (see Sigler, pp. 77-81) as x^2 = (41/12)^2 = 1681/144, y^2 = (49/12)^2 = 2401/144 and z^2 = (31/12)^2 = 961/144. This corresponds to the integer quartet (C; x, y, z) = (720; 41, 49, 31) corresponding to the primitive Pythagorean triple [9, 40, 41].
