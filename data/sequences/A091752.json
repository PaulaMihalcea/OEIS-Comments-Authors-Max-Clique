Schulte conjectured that a(s; n, m) = T(s; (s+1)*n - m - 1, m - s), for n > = 1 and m = s, s+1, ..., s*n, with the row polynomials RT(s; n, x) = Sum_{m = 0..s*n} T(s; n, m)*x^m of the triangle T(s), n >= 0, defined by the Rodrigues-type formula exp(x^(s+1)/(s+1)) (d/dx)^n exp(-x^(s+1)/(s+1)) = (-1)^n*RT(s; n, x). Thus the rows of (-1,s)S2 are every (s+1)-th upwards antidiagonals of T(s), but with offset m = s instead of m = 0.", "The proof of the conjecture follows by showing the Carlitz recurrence for (-1,s)S2, but with offset n = 0 and m = 0; that is, a(s; n+1, m+s) =: aHat(s; n, m) = Sum_{j = 0..s} binomial(s, j)*fallfac(s + m - j - (s+1)*n , s-j)*aHat(s; n-1, m-j), for n >= 0, m = 0, 1, ..., s*n, with aHat(s; 0, 0) = 1 and aHat(s; n, m) = 0 for m < 0 and m > s*n. The falling factorials are fallfac(x, n). With aHat(s; n, m) = T(s; (s+1)*n - m, m) this leads to a recurrence for T(s) which is equivalent to the recurrence for the row polynomials RT(s), namely RT(s; n, x) = Sum_{j=0 .. s} binomial(s, j)*x^j*fallfac(s - j - n, s - j)*RT(s; n - (s+1) + j, x), for n >= 1, and RT(s; 0, x) = 1. This, in turn, can be proved by induction over n >= 1 from the simpler recurrence for RT(s) obtained directly from the Rodrigues-type definition, namely RT(s; n, x) = x^s*RT(s; n-1, x) - (d/dx)RT(s; n-1, x), n >= 1,with RT(s; 0, x) = 1.", "The e.g.f. of the triangle T(s), that is of the row polynomials {RT(s;n, x)}_{n>=0}, is E(s; t, x) = exp((x^(s+1) - (x - t)^(s+1))/(s+1)). This can be proved from the simple RT(s) recurrence, leading to (d/dt + d/dx)E(s; t, x) = x^s*E(s; t, x), with E(s; 0, x) = 1. After using E(s; t, x) = 1*exp(x^(s+1)/(s+1) + f(s; t, x)), with f(s; 0, x) = -x^(s+1)/(s+1), this becomes (d/dx - d/dt)f(s; t, x) = 0 meaning that f is a function of y = x - t, say, g(s; y) = - y^(s+1)/(s+1) because it has to become f(s; 0, x) for t = 0.", "The explicit form for (-1,s)S2 is a(s; n, m) = (-1)^(n*s -m)*((s+1)*n - m-1)!/((s+1)^(n-1)*(n-1)!)*Sum_{j=0..floor((m-s)/(s+1))} (-1)^j* binomial(n-1, j)*binomial((s+1)*(n-1-j), m - s - (s+1)*j).
