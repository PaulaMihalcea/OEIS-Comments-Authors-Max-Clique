The dispersion of s is the array D whose n-th row is (t(n), s(t(n)), s(s(t(n)), s(s(s(t(n)))), ...).  Every positive integer occurs exactly once in D, so that, as a sequence, D is a permutation of the positive integers.  The sequence u given by u(n)=(number of the row of D that contains n) is a fractal sequence.
