This implies that it is also divisible by n^e for e=1,2 and 3, but not necessarily for e=4. It follows also that cn(n)-2, with cn(n)=cb(n)/(n+1) being the n-th Catalan number A000108(n), is divisible by any prime n. In fact, for any n>0, cn(n)-2 = (n+1)cb(n)-2 implies (cn(n)-2) mod n = (cb(n)-2) mod n = a(n). The sequence a(n) is of interest as a prime-testing sequence similar to Fermat's, albeit not a practical one until/unless an efficient algorithm to compute moduli of binomial coefficients is found.
