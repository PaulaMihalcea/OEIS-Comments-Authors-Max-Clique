However, this version does not map the irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomials (A014580) straight to the primes (A000040), but instead fixes the intersection of those two sets (A091206), and maps the elements in their set-wise difference A014580 \\ A000040 (= A091214) in numerical order to the set-wise difference A000040 \\ A014580 (= A091209).", "The composite values are defined by the multiplicativity.
