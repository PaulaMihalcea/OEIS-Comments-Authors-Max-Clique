Because the length is even and palindromic numbers are symmetric, for any digit \u201c1\u201d that is related with 2^n in its expansion which n is even, there are another digit \u201c1\u201d that is related with 2^m in its expansion which m is odd. 2^n+2^m is always divisible by 3 if n is even and m is odd. Therefore A048701(n) is divisible by 3, so A048701(n+1) - A048701(n) is divisible by 3 for n > 0. In conclusion, A048701(n+1) - A048701(n) is always divisible by 6 for n > 1. (End)"], "link": ["N. J.
