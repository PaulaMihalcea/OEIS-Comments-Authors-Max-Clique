(This corresponds to the alternative definition of Hensley and Richards, p. 378 (*) or Richards, p. 423, 1.5 Definition and (*).) Note that the definition of \"admissibility\" is translation invariant (see the Note by Richards, p. 424, which is obvious from the translation equivalence of complete residue systems modulo p). Therefore the interval I_n = [0, n-1] of length n has been chosen. The b_1 = 0 choice is conventional. Without this choice other admissible k-tuples are obtained by translation as long as b_k + a < n-1. E.g., for n = 8 and k = 3 the tuple [1, 5, 7] is admissible and a translation of the considered tuple [0, 4, 6].", "Only primes p <= k have to be tested to decide on the admissibility of a B_k tuple because for larger k there is always some residue class which contains none of the k members of B_k.", "Because p = 2 already forbids even and odd numbers to appear in B_k for k >= 2, one can for the admissibility test eliminate all odd numbers in the chosen I_n. Therefore, only Ieven_n:= [0, 2, ..., 2*floor((n-1)/2)] =: 2*[0, 1, ..., floor((n-1)/2)] need be considered. B_1 = [0] is admissible for all n >= 1.", "Because only the interval Ieven_n is of relevance, there will occur repetitions for admissible tuples for n if n = 2*k+1 and n = 2*k+2.", "With the set B_k(p) = B_k (mod p) := {0, b_1 (mod p), ..., b_k (mod p)} the criterion for admissibility can be written as p - #(B_k(p)) > 0, for all primes 3 <= p <= k (because there are p congruence classes defined by smallest nonnegative complete residue system [0, 1, ..., p-1]).", "Admissible tuples (starting with 0) with least b_k - b_1 = b_k value give rise to prime k-constellations of diameter b_k. E.g., for k = 2 the admissible tuple [0, 4] does not lead to a prime 2-constellation for n >= 5; [0, 6] is out for n >= 7, ... .
