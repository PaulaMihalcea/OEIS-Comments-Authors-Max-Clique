Adams-Watters_, Aug 05 2012: Sketch of proof that the above sum of primes results in this sequence. If S_n is the set of possible values of the signed sums for the first n primes, then S_{n+1} = S_n U (S_n + prime(n+1)) U (S_n - prime(n+1)). Beyond about n=4, this will be everything even or everything odd in an interval around zero, and then a fringe on either side; the size of the interval will be 2 * A007504(n) - k for some small k. Recursively, since prime(n) << A007504(n), this will continue to hold. Hence the sequence continues to alternate 0's and 1's.  A quite modest estimate on the distribution of primes suffices to complete the proof.", "For number of solutions see A022894, A113040; also A083309."], "link": ["StackExchange, <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/176394/a-prime-number-pattern\">A prime number pattern</a>, Jul 29 2012.", "<a href=\"/index/Rec#order_02\">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,1)."], "mathematica": ["PadRight[{2},120,{0,1}] (* _Harvey P.
