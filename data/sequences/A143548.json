The first differences of each row are symmetric. For k > p^2, the solutions are just shifted by m*p^2 for m > 0. An open question is whether every integer appears in this sequence.

Let p=prime(n) and let r be a primitive root of p (see A001918 and A060749). Then the terms in row n are r^(k*p) (mod p^2) for k=0..p-2. - _T. D.
