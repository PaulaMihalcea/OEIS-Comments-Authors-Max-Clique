If N(rho(n)) equals +1 or -1 then 1/rho(n), which is an element of Q(rho(n)), is in fact an integer in this number field. For the 1/rho(n) formula in terms of the C coefficients see A230079. Thus 1/rho(n) is a  Q(rho(n))-integer if and only if  C(n, 0) is +1 or -1 , and this happens if and only if n is from the set {A230078(k), k >= 2}.", "The negation says that, for n a positive integer, 1/rho(n) is not a Q(rho(n))-integer if and only if n is 1 or of the form 2*p^m, m >= 0 and p a prime, which are the numbers of A138929 including 1.", "The proof uses for case (i): n = 2*m+1, m >= 1, the fact that C(2*m+1, 0)^2  = (product( 2*cos(Pi*(2*l+1)/(2*m+1)), l=0 .. m-1 and gcd(2*l+1, 2*m+1) = 1))^2 = (product(2*cos(Pi*k/(2*m+1)), k=1..L and gcd(k, 2*m+1) = 1))^2 = cyclotomic(2*m +1, -1). See the linked Q(rho(n)) paper, eq. (31), for a product formula for cyclotomic(n, -1). With the prime factorization of 2*m+1, and the fact that only the squarefree kernel of 2*m+1 enters (see an Oct 29 2013 comment on A013595), one finds, form the formula for cyclotomic(p1*p2*...*pk, x) involving the Moebius function, cyclotomic(2*m +1, -1) = +1, m >= 1.  C(1, 0) = +2. For case (ii): n even, one has C(2^m, 0) = 0, -2, +2,  for m = 1 , 2, >=3, respectively (see eq. (39) of the linked Q(rho(n)) paper). For odd prime p:  (-1)^((p-1)/2)*C(2*p^m, 0) = cyclotomic(2*p^m, -1) =  cyclotomic(2*p, -1) = cyclotomic(p, +1) = p, for m >= 1. For more than one odd prime in the squarefree kernel of n = 2*m, m >= 1, one finds C(2*m, 0) = +1 from cyclotomic(2*p1*...*pk, -1) = +1, for k >= 2.
