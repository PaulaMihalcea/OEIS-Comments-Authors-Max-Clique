The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is the number of maximal weakly increasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is one plus the number of strict descents in the same composition. For example, the weakly increasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3),(2),(1,2,2),(1,2,5),(1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 5. The 4 strict descents together with the weak ascents are: 3 > 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 5 > 1 <= 1 <= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020"], "formula": ["a(0) = 0, a(n) = A124761(n) + 1 for n > 0."], "example": ["Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; the increasing runs are 2; 1,1; so a(11) = 2.", "The table starts:", "  0", "  1", "  1 1", "  1 2 1 1", "  1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1", "  1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1", "  1 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1"], "mathematica": ["stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;", "Table[Length[Split[stc[n],#1<=#2&]],{n,0,100}] (* _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020 *)"], "xref": ["Cf.
