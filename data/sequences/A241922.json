Indeed, if m^2 - k^2 is semiprime, then (m-k)*(m+k) = p*q, where p<=q are primes. Here we consider two possible cases. 1) m-k=1, m+k=p*q and 2) m-k=p, m+k=q. But in the first case k=m-1>m-p, i.e., more than k in the second case. In view of the minimality k, we only have to consider case 2). In this case we have m-/+k both are primes p<=q (with equality in case k=0) and thus 2*m = p + q. Conversely, let the Goldbach conjecture be true. Then for a perfect square n>=4, we have 2*sqrt(n)=p+q (p<=q are both primes). Thus n=((p+q)/2)^2 and n-((p-q)/2)^2=p*q is semiprime. Hence a(n) is a square not exceeding ((p-q)/2)^2.", "Note that a(n)=2 for 1,2,3,12,17,28,32,72,...", "All these numbers are in A100570.
