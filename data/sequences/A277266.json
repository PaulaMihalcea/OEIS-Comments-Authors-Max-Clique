For any Fibonacci sequence containing n after the first two terms, the number m immediately before n in the sequence satisfies 0 <= m <= n. The sequences (0, n), (1, n-1), (2, n-2), ..., (n, 0) all contain n as the next term. There are n+1 of these sequences. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1. If n/2 <= m <= n, then the sequence (2m-n, n-m) contains n after 2 terms. There are floor(n/2)+1 of these sequences. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1/2. Similarly, there are approximately n/(Fibonacci(x)*Fibonacci(x+1)) sequences that contain n after x terms. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1/(Fibonacci(x)*Fibonacci(x+1)).
