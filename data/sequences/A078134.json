Proof: we restrict ourselves on a(n)>0 (the case a(n)=0 is trivial). Let T(i), 1<=i<=a(n), be the a(n) different sum expressions of squares >1 representing n. Then, adding k^2 to those expressions, we get a(n) sums of squares T(i)+k^2, obviously representing n+k^2, thus a(n+k^2) cannot be less than a(n).", "Second statement of monotony: a(n+m)>=max(a(n),a(m)) for all m with a(m)>1. Proof: let T(i), 1<=i<=a(n), be the a(n) different sum expressions of squares >1 representing n; let S(i), 1<=i<=a(m), be the a(m) different sum expressions of squares >1 representing m. Then, adding those expressions, we get a(n) sums of squares T(i)+S(1), representing n+m, further we get a(m) sums T(1)+S(i), also representing n+m, thus a(n+m) cannot be less than the maximum of a(n) and a(m).", "The author's conjecture holds true. Proof by induction: b(0) exists; if b(k) exists, then a(j)>k for all j>b(k). Setting m:=b(k)+1, we find that there are k+1 sums B(0,i) of squares >1, 1<=i<=k+1, with m=B(0,i). Further there are k+1 such sum expressions B(1,i), B(2,i) and B(3,i), 1<=i<=k+1, representing m+1, m+2 and m+3, respectively. For n>b(k) we have n=m+4*floor((n-m)/4)+(n-m) mod 4.", "Thus n=m+r+s*2^2, where r=0,1,2 or 3. Hence n can be written B(r,i)+s*2^2 and there are k+1 such representations. Let q be the maximal number (to be squared) occurring as a term within those sum expressions B(r,i), 0<=r<=3,1<=i<=k+1. We select a number p>q and we set c:=b(k)+p^2. For n>c, we have the k+1 representations B(r(n),i)+s(n)*2^2.", "Additionally, for n-p^2 (which is >b(k)) there are also k+1 representations B(r_p,i)+s_p*2^2, where r_p:=r(n-p^2), s_p:=s(n-p^2). Thus n can be written B(r(n),i)+s(n)*2^2, 1<=i<=k+1 and B(r_p,i)+s_p*2^2+p^2, 1<=i<=k+1.", "By choice of p all these sum representations of n are different, which implies, that there are 2k+2 such representations.
