In other words f(k)<1 for all k. At first glance it seems that f(12) is the largest value of f, followed by f(120), f(60) and so on. Proving that f(12) is indeed the largest value would prove the Riemann Hypothesis. However, f(12) is not the largest value.", "The terms shown are merely the maxima for \"small\" values of k. If the function f(k) is evaluated at colossally abundant numbers (A004490), we find that beyond the 58th colossally abundant number, which is over 10^76, the function is greater than f(12) and increasing at each subsequence colossally abundant number.
