Sloane_, Jul 21 2014 (Start): It is not difficult to show that the preceding conjecture is correct. In fact one can give an explicit formula for the n-th term. At generation n >= 2, the configuration of ON cells consists of a set of concentric diamonds (see the illustration). The sizes of the diamonds are given by the (n-2)nd term of A245191. Let N = A245191(n-2) = Sum_{i>=0} b_i*2^i. Then the ON cells form a set of diamonds with edge-lengths i+2 for each b_i = 1. The i-th diamond contains 4*(i+1) ON cells, and the total number of ON cells is therefore a(n) = 4*Sum_i (i+1)*b_i. The b_i are given explicitly in A245191.", "For example, if n=11, N = A245191(9) = 544 = 2^5 + 2^9, so b_5 = b_9 = 1, there are two diamonds, of side lengths 7 and 11, containing a total of 4*(6+10) = 64 = a(11) ON cells.
