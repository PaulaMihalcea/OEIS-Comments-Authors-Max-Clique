With the {A026424, A028260} classes, multiplying a member of one class by a prime gives a member of the other class. With the {A000028, A000379} classes, adding a factor to the Fermi-Dirac factorization of a member of one class gives a member of the other class. So, if 4 is not a Fermi-Dirac factor of k, k and 4k will be in different classes of the {A000028, A000379} set; but k and 4k will be in the same class of the {A026424, A028260} set. For two numbers to necessarily be in different classes when they differ in either of the 2 ways described above, 3 classes are needed.", "With the classes defined by this sequence, no two of k, 2k and 4k are in the same class. This is a consequence of the following stronger property: if k is any positive integer and m is a member of A050376 (often called Fermi-Dirac primes), then no two of k, k * m, k * m^2 are in the same class. Also, if p and q are consecutive primes, then k * p and k * q are in different classes.", "Further properties are given in the sequences that list the classes: A332820, A332821, A332822."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A332823/b332823.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..65537</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Pri#prime_indices\">Index entries for sequences computed from indices in prime factorization</a>"], "formula": ["a(n) = A102283(A048675(n)) = -1 + (1 + A048675(n)) mod 3.", "a(1) = 0; for n > 1, a(n) = A102283[(A067029(n) * (2-(A000035(A055396(n))))) + a(A028234(n))].", "For all n >= 1, k >= 1: (Start)", "a(n * k) == a(n) + a(k) (mod 3).", "a(A331590(n,k)) == a(n) + a(k) (mod 3).", "a(n^2) = -a(n).", "a(A003961(n)) = -a(n).", "a(A297845(n,k)) = a(n) * a(k).", "(End)", "For all n >= 1: (Start)", "a(A000040(n)) = (-1)^(n-1).", "a(A225546(n)) = a(n).", "a(A097248(n)) = a(n).", "a(A332461(n)) = a(A332462(n)) = A332814(n).", "(End)"], "program": ["(PARI) A332823(n) = { my(f = factor(n),u=(sum(k=1, #f~, f[k, 2]*2^primepi(f[k, 1]))/2)%3); if(2==u,-1,u); };"], "xref": ["Cf.
