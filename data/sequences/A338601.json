Any planar network with 10 resistors presented in this way, has a corresponding tiling of a p X q rectangle by 10 squares, and the inverse resistance q/p can be obtained in the same way. According to the definition of a(n) this is not the case here, so there must be crossing edges in every drawing. It should be noticed though, that all the networks (without the battery edge) are planar. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Jan 03 2021", "Version 2 of the visualization (see link section) shows that all these exceptional networks are extensions of the same network with 8 resistors. It is the graph K_3_3 without the 'battery edge' A-Z and shall be named VG8. This network VG8 has no related squared rectangle, because it has no series-parallel sub-nets and has resistance 5/4, but there is no such network with resistance 4/5.
