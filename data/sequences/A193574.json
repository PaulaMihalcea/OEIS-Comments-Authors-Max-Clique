Similarly, a(n)=p^k with p prime an k>1 leads to the contradiction (p^k-1)/(p-1) | n.", "(2)  n=p^(2*k), k>=1 and 2*k+1 prime, when a(n) = sigma(n) for n>2: Because n having two distinct prime factors implies sigma(n) composite, and if n is an odd power of a prime then 2|sigma(n). Finally, if 2*k+1=u*v  with  u,v > 1 then sigma(p^(u-1)) divides sigma(p^(2*k)), but not p^(2k), for any prime p, contradicting minimality of a(n). For example, no number sigma(p^8) for any prime p is in the sequence.", "(3)  The converse of (2) is false since, e.g. sigma(7^2) = 3*19 so that a(7^2) = 3, and sigma(2^10) = 23*89 so that a(2^10) = 23.", "(4)  Conjecture: a(n) > n implies a(n) = sigma(n); tested through n = 20000000.", "(5)  Subsequences are: A053183 (sigma(p^2) is prime for prime p), A190527 (sigma(p^4) is prime for prime p), A194257 (sigma(p^6) is prime for prime p), A286301 (sigma(p^10) is prime for prime p)", "(6)  Subsequences are: A000668 (primes of form 2^p-1), A076481 (primes of form (3^p-1)/2), A086122 (primes of form (5^p-1)/4), A102170 (primes of form (7^p-1)/6), all when p is prime.", "(End)", "Up to n = 10^6, there are 89 distinct elements.
