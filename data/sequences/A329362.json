For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100)."], "example": ["The co-Lyndon factorizations of the initial terms of A000002:", "                      () = 0", "                     (1) = (1)", "                    (12) = (1)(2)", "                   (122) = (1)(2)(2)", "                  (1221) = (1)(221)", "                 (12211) = (1)(2211)", "                (122112) = (1)(2211)(2)", "               (1221121) = (1)(221121)", "              (12211212) = (1)(221121)(2)", "             (122112122) = (1)(221121)(2)(2)", "            (1221121221) = (1)(221121)(221)", "           (12211212212) = (1)(221121)(221)(2)", "          (122112122122) = (1)(221121)(221)(2)(2)", "         (1221121221221) = (1)(221121)(221)(221)", "        (12211212212211) = (1)(221121)(2212211)", "       (122112122122112) = (1)(221121)(2212211)(2)", "      (1221121221221121) = (1)(221121)(221221121)", "     (12211212212211211) = (1)(221121)(2212211211)", "    (122112122122112112) = (1)(221121)(2212211211)(2)", "   (1221121221221121122) = (1)(221121)(2212211211)(2)(2)", "  (12211212212211211221) = (1)(221121)(2212211211)(221)"], "mathematica": ["kolagrow[q_]:=If[Length[q]<2,Take[{1,2},Length[q]+1],Append[q,Switch[{q[[Length[Split[q]]]],q[[-2]],Last[q]},{1,1,1},0,{1,1,2},1,{1,2,1},2,{1,2,2},0,{2,1,1},2,{2,1,2},2,{2,2,1},1,{2,2,2},1]]]", "kol[n_Integer]:=If[n==0,{},Nest[kolagrow,{1},n-1]];", "colynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]]@Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]];", "Table[Length[colynfac[kol[n]]],{n,0,100}]"], "xref": ["The non-\"co\" version is A296658.", "Cf.
