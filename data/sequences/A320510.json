Then a(n) is the number of integer partitions of n whose differences (with the last part taken to be 0) are strictly decreasing. The Heinz numbers of these partitions are given by A325461. Of course, the number of such integer partitions of n is also the number of reversed integer partitions of n whose differences are strictly decreasing, which is the author's interpretation. - _Gus Wiseman_, May 04 2019"], "link": ["Fausto A.
