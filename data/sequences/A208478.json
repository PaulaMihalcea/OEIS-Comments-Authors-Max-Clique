Every partition of n has n ranks. This is a generalization of the Dyson's rank of a partition which is the largest part minus the number of parts. Since the first part of a partition is also the largest part of the same partition so the Dyson's rank of a partition is the case for k = 1.", "The sum of the k-th ranks of all partitions of n is equal to zero.", "Also T(n,k) = number of partitions of n with negative k-th rank.", "It appears that reversed rows converge to A000070, the same as A208482. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 11 2012", "From _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 12 2019: (Start)", "1) The k-th part of a partition of n is also the number of parts >= k of its conjugate partition.", "2) The k-th rank of a partitions is also the number of parts >= k of its conjugate partition minus the number of parts >= k.", "For example: for n = 9 consider the partition [5, 3, 1]. The first part is 5, so the conjugate partition has five parts >= 1. The second part is 3, so the conjugate partition has three parts >= 2. The third part is 1, so the conjugate partition has only one part >= 3. The mentioned conjugate partition is [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. And viceversa, consider the partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. The first part is 3, so the conjugate partition has three parts >= 1. The second part is 2, so the conjugate partition has two parts >= 2. the Third part is 2, so the conjugate partition has two parts >= 3, and so on. In this case the conjugate partition is [5, 3, 1].", "3) The difference between the k-th part and the (k+1)-st part of the partition of n is also the number of k's in its conjugate partition. For example: consider the partition [5, 3, 1]. The difference between the first and the second part is 5 - 3 = 2, equals the number of 1's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the second and the third part is 3 - 1 = 2, equals the number of 2's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the third and the fourth (virtual) part is 1 - 0 = 1, equals the number of 3's in its conjugate partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. And viceversa, consider the partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. The difference between the first and the second part is 3 - 2 = 1, equals the number of 1's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the second and the third part is 2 - 2 = 0, equals the number of 2's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the third and the fourth part is 2 - 1 = 1, equals the number of 3's in its conjugate partition, and so on.", "4) The list of n ranks of a partition of n equals the list of n ranks multipled by -1 of its conjugate partition. For example the nine ranks of the partition [5, 3, 1] of 9 are [2, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0], and the nine ranks of its conjugate partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1] are [-2, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].", "For a list of partitions of the positive integers ordered by its k-th ranks see A330370.
