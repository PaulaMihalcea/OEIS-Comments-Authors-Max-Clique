Similar polynomials are treated in Serre's paper. The discriminant of the polynomial is 9584=16*599 and 599 is the only prime for which the polynomial has 4 distinct zeros. The primes p yielding 5 distinct zeros, A106281, correspond to the periods of the sequences A001591(k) mod p and A074048(k) mod p having length less than p. The Lucas 5-step sequence mod p has one additional prime p for which the period is less than p: the 599 factor of the discriminant. For this prime, the Fibonacci 5-step sequence mod p has a period of p(p-1)."], "link": ["J.-P.
