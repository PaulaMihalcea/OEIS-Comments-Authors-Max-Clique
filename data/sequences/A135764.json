A more usual bijection is to take the natural numbers A000027 and write them in the usual OEIS square array format. However this bijection has the advantage that it can be formed by iterating the usual bijection between N and 2N. - _Joshua Zucker_, Nov 04 2011", "The array can be used to determine the configurations of k-th Towers of Hanoi moves, by labeling odd row terms C,B,A,C,B,A,... and even row terms B,C,A,B,C,A,.... Then given k equal to or greater than term \"a\" in each n-th row, but less than the next row term, record the label A, B, or C for term \"a\". This denotes the peg position for the disc corresponding to the n-th row. For example, with k = 25, five discs are in motion since the binary for 25 = 11001, five bits. We find that 25 in row 5 is greater than 16 labeled C, but less than 48. Thus, disc 5 is on peg C. In the 4th row, 25 is greater than 24 (a C), but less than 40, so goes onto the C peg. Similarly, disc 3 is on A, 2 is on A, and disc 1 is on A. Thus, discs 2 and 3 are on peg A, while 1, 4, and 5 are on peg C. - _Gary W.
