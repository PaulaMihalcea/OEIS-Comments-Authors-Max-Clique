A set D of squares of Q(n X m) is a dominating set for Q(n X m) if every square of Q(n X m) is either in D or adjacent to a square in D. The minimum size of a dominating set of Q(n X m) is the domination number, denoted by gamma(Q(n X m)).", "Less formally, gamma(Q(n X m)) is the number of queens that are necessary and sufficient to all squares of the n X m chessboard be occupied or attacked.", "Chessboard 8 X 11 is of special interest, because it cannot be dominated by 5 queens, although the larger boards 9 X 11, 10 X 11 and 11 X 11 are.
