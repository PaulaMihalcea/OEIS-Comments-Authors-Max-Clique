No diagonal steps (length sqrt(2)) are allowed. B_n is called connected if there exists no path of 0's which dissects the grid into two parts.", "An island of 0's (a 0-island) in B_n is defined as a set of 0's for which each pair is connected by a path of 0's, and a 0 entry at the coast of a 0-island has at least one entry 1 one step away. A single square filled with a 0 is a 0-island if all four neighbors 1 step (of length 1) apart are filled with 1's. If k=0 there exists no such 0-island. See the n=4 examples with k >=1 below. The k = 1 matrix has one simply connected 0-island of four squares. The four k = 2 matrices have two 0-islands consisting of one square each.", "See the link with the figures by K. N. where red squares stand for 1 and empty squares for 0. Each matrix appears there rotated by 45 degrees in the counterclockwise direction.
