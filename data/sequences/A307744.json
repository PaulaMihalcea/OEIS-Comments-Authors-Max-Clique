Between each n_k where A051064(n_k) = k >= 2 and the nearest n_k' where A051064(n_k') > k (or n_k' = 0 if nearer), there are 2^(k-2) indices where k occurs in this sequence, forming a 2^(k-2)-tuple. The 2^(k-2)-tuples have identical patterns and each has symmetry about an n_(k-1) where A051064(n_(k-1)) = k-1.", "For a given k, the tuples described above are periodic with two per fundamental period, and the closest pairs of these tuples jointly form the pattern of one of the equivalent tuples for k+1. These patterns relate to the nonperiodic pattern for 0's and to the Cantor set as follows.", "Let S_k be the sequence of positive indices at which k occurs, with 3^(k-2) subtracted when k >= 2. Given its ruler-type symmetries, S_k k >= 2 is determined by its first 2^(k-2) terms, which are the same as the first 2^(k-2) terms of S_i for i > k. The limiting sequence as k goes to infinity is S_0, which is A191108. {A191108(i)/(2*3^k) | 1 <= i <= 2^k} is the set of center points of the intervals deleted at step k+1 when generating the Cantor ternary set. This leads to the following scaling property.", "Define c: Z -> P(R) so that c(n) is the scaled and translated Cantor ternary set spanning [n-1, n+1], and let C_k be the union of c(n) for all integer n with a(n) = k. Clearly C_1 consists of a scaled Cantor set repeated with period 3. (The set's two nonempty thirds occur at alternating intervals of 4/3 and 5/3.) For k >= 1, C_k is C_1 scaled by 3^(k-1), consisting therefore of a scaled Cantor set repeated with period 3^k. C_0 is special: C_0 = (C_0)*3 = (C_0)/3 = -C_0. Specifically, (C_0)/2 is the closure of the Cantor ternary set under multiplication by 3 and by -1.", "Take a Sierpinski arrowhead curve formed of unit edges numbered consecutively from 0 at its axis of symmetry and aligned with an infinite Sierpinski gasket so that each edge is contained in the boundary of either the plane sector occupied by the gasket or a triangular region of the gasket's complement.
