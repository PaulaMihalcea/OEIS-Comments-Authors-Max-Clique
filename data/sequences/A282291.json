The choices for constructing the next partition are: either remove some parts from the partition, but with the constraint that if any summand k is removed, then all copies of k present in partition must be removed in too. One may remove all copies of several distinct summands as well. If by such a removal of parts we can find any smaller partitions that have not yet occurred in the sequence, then we choose the one which has the smallest Heinz encoding value to be a(n+1). On the other hand, if all partitions obtained by such removals have already occurred in the sequence, one must then add one or more parts to the current partition, but with the constraint that one is allowed to use only summands that do not already occur in partition (but any number of such summands may be used, also of more than one kind, as long as such summands are not already present in the partition that corresponds to a(n)). Of all such valid new partitions not already encountered, one with the smallest Heinz encoding value is chosen to be a(n+1).
