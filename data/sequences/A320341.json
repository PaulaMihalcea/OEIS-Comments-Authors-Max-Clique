Then b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_m is a cyclic composition of n. The process can be reversed (since b_1, b_2, ..., b_m >= 1). The only necklace that cannot be obtained from a cyclic composition is the one having all 1's, which we exclude. In the above process, b_i = 1 if and only if the i-th 0 in the above process is followed by 0 (to the right of it on the circle).
