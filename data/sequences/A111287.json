Shiu has proved that if (a,b) = 1 then the arithmetic progression a, a + b, ..., a + k*b, ... contains arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive primes. Since, for any positive integer b, there are thus arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive primes congruent to 1 mod b, there must be infinitely many a(n) that are divisible by b.", "To clarify the previous comment: If the sum of the primes up to some point is s (mod b), then we need exactly b-s consecutive primes equal to 1 (mod b) to produce a sum divisible by b. Hence when there are b-1 consecutive primes congruent to 1 (mod b), then the sum of primes up to one of those primes will be divisible by b. - _T. D. Noe_, Dec 02 2009"], "link": ["T. D.
