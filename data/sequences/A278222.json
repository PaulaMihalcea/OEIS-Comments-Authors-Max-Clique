In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.", "Because the Doudna map n -> A005940(1+n) is an isomorphism from \"unary-binary encoding of factorization\" (see A156552) to the ordinary prime factorization domain, it follows that the equivalence classes of this sequence match with any such sequence b, where b(n) is computed from the lengths of 1-runs in the binary representation of n and the order of those 1-runs does not matter. Particularly, this holds for any sequence that is obtained as a \"Run Length Transform\", i.e., where b(n) = Product S(i), for some function S, where i runs through the lengths of runs of 1's in the binary expansion of n (see the index entry for some of the known ones).", "However, this sequence itself is not a run length transform of any sequence (which can be seen for example from the fact that A046523 is not multiplicative).", "Furthermore, this matches not only with sequences involving products of S(i), but with any sequence obtained with any commutative function applied cumulatively, like e.g., A000120 (binary weight, obtained in this case as Sum identity(i)), and A069010 (number of runs of 1's in binary representation of n, obtained as Sum signum(i))."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A278222/b278222.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..65537</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Bi#binary\">Index entries for sequences related to binary expansion of n</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Eu#epf\">Index entries for sequences computed from exponents in factorization of n</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Ru#rlt\">Index entries for sequences computed with run length transform</a>"], "formula": ["a(n) = A046523(A005940(1+n)).", "a(n) = A124859(A278159(n)).", "a(n) = A278219(A006068(n))."], "mathematica": ["f[n_, i_, x_] := Which[n == 0, x, EvenQ@ n, f[n/2, i + 1, x], True, f[(n - 1)/2, i, x Prime@ i]]; Array[If[# == 1, 1, Times @@ MapIndexed[ Prime[First[#2]]^#1 &, Sort[FactorInteger[#][[All, -1]], Greater]]] &@ f[# - 1, 1, 1] &, 99] (* _Michael De Vlieger_, May 09 2017 *)"], "program": ["(Scheme) (define (A278222 n) (A046523 (A005940 (+ 1 n))))", "(Python)", "from sympy import prime, factorint", "import math", "def A(n): return n - 2**int(math.floor(math.log(n, 2)))", "def b(n): return n + 1 if n<2 else prime(1 + (len(bin(n)[2:]) - bin(n)[2:].count(\"1\"))) * b(A(n))", "def a005940(n): return b(n - 1)", "def P(n):", "    f = factorint(n)", "    return sorted([f[i] for i in f])", "def a046523(n):", "    x=1", "    while True:", "        if P(n) == P(x): return x", "        else: x+=1", "def a(n): return a046523(a005940(n + 1)) # _Indranil Ghosh_, May 05 2017"], "xref": ["Cf.
