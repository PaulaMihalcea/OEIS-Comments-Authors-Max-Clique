Metlov solved it, submitting his result in the J language created by Kenneth Iverson. The program given below is only five tokens long. J defines a series of three functions to be a \"fork\" defined by x (f g h ) y = (x f y) g (f h y) - a generalization of the usual mathematical practice of writing (f + g) y to mean (f y) + (g y). J also has a primitive \"half\" and has a dummy function \"cap\" whose purpose is to permit more forks to be written. 3 (* * +) 5 is thus (3 * 5) * (3 + 5) or 120. cap half 3 (* * +) 5 is thus 60.", "This sequence is the dimensions of the various irreducible representations of SU(3).
