Thus, for all n>=1, a(n) is in {-1, 0, 1}, a(n+1) != a(n), and if a(n) = 0, a(n+1) = -a(n-1), while if a(n) != 0, either a(n+1) = 0 and a(n+2) = -a(n) or a(n+1) = -a(n). A further consequence is that the maximum gap between equal values is 4: for all n, there is an integer k, 1<k<=4 such that a(n+k)=a(n). - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Oct 05 2014", "From _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 07 2015: (Start)", "Second differences: {-1, -1, 1, 1, -2, 2, -1, -1, 2, -1, -1, 1, 1, ...}", "The sequence of first differences bounces between -1 and 1 with a slope whose absolute value is either 1 or 2.
