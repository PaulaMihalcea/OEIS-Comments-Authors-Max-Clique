See A049444 for a signed version of this array. The unsigned 2-Stirling numbers of the first kind count the permutations of the set {1,2,...,n} into k disjoint cycles, with the restriction that the elements 1 and 2 belong to distinct cycles. This is the particular case r = 2 of the unsigned r-Stirling numbers of the first kind, which count the permutations of the set {1,2,...,n} into k disjoint cycles, with the restriction that the numbers 1, 2, ..., r belong to distinct cycles. The case r = 1 gives the usual unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, abs(A008275); for other cases see A143492 (r = 3) and A143493 (r = 4). The corresponding 2-Stirling numbers of the second kind can be found in A143494.", "In general, the lower unitriangular array of unsigned r-Stirling numbers of the first kind (with suitable offsets in the row and column indexing) equals the matrix product St1 * P^(r-1), where St1 is the array of unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, abs(A008275) and P is Pascal's triangle, A007318. The theory of r-Stirling numbers of both kinds is developed in [Broder].
