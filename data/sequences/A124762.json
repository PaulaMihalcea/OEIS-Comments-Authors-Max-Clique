The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. This sequence gives the number of adjacent equal terms in the n-th composition in standard order. Alternatively, a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal anti-runs in the same composition, where anti-runs are sequences without any adjacent equal terms. For example, the 1234567th composition in standard order is (3,2,1,2,2,1,2,5,1,1,1) with anti-runs ((3,2,1,2),(2,1,2,5,1),(1),(1)), so a(1234567) = 4 - 1 = 3. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020"], "formula": ["For a composition b(1),...,b(k), a(n) = Sum_{1<=i=1<k, b(i)=b(i+1)} 1.", "For n > 0, a(n) = A333381(n) - 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020"], "example": ["Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; 2>1=1, so a(11) = 1.", "The table starts:", "  0", "  0", "  0 1", "  0 0 0 2", "  0 0 1 1 0 0 1 3", "  0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 4", "  0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 5"], "mathematica": ["stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;", "Table[Length[Select[Partition[stc[n],2,1],SameQ@@#&]],{n,0,100}] (* _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020 *)"], "xref": ["Cf.
