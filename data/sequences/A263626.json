The authors apparently refer to formula (20) in Theorem 2 (p. 139) in Soza\u0144ski (1980). (See also p. 218 in  Greaves et al. (2016).)", "The so-called \"Seidel matrix\" of a graph G was apparently introduced by the Dutch mathematician Johan Jacob Seidel (1967, 1968, and with van Lint in 1966). They are not related to the so-called Euler-Seidel (or just Seidel) matrices named after Leonhard Euler and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.", "A Seidel matrix S = S(G) of a simple labeled graph G with vertex set V = {v_1, ..., v_n} is an n x n symmetric matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the n vertices such that S(i,j) is defined in the following way: S(i,j) = 0 iff i = j; S(i,j) = -1 iff vertex v_i is connected to vertex v_j (i <> j), and S(i,j) = 1 iff vertex v_i is not connected to vertex v_j (i <> j). Thus, S(G) = J - I - 2*A(G), where J is an n x n matrix of 1's, I is the n x n identity matrix, and A(G) is the adjancecy matrix of the labeled graph G.", "Two Seidel matrices S1 and S2 are said to be equivalent if S1 can be obtained from S2 by a sequence of simultaneous row i to j and column i to j permutations or by a simultaneous multiplication of a row i and a column i by -1.", "Thus, Seidel matrices S1 and S2 are equivalent iff there is a symmetric signed permutation matrix P such that S1 = P*S2*P^T.", "A Seidel matrix S is called \"self-complementary\" if S is equivalent to -S. Thus, S is self-complementary iff there is a symmetric signed permutation matrix P such that S = -P*S*P^T.

On the other hand, a simultaneous multiplication of row i and column i by -1 corresponds to what Mallows and Sloane (1975) call \"switching at node\" v_i: if A(i) is the set of vertices in V to which v_i is connected and B(i) is the set of vertices in V to which v_i is not connected, \"switching at node v_i\" means switching the sets A(i) and B(i) (the vertices connected with the vertices non-connected to v_i). Of course, either A(i) or B(i) may be empty.", "Mallows and Sloane (1975) proved that the number of equivalence classes of Seidel matrices of order n is equal to the number of unlabeled even graphs (known colloquially as unlabeled \"Euler graphs\").
