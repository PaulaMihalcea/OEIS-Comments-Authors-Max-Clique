This notion is considered in the subject of symmetry breaking of simple (finite or infinite) graphs. Two vertex-colorings of a graph are called equivalent if there is an automorphism of the graph which preserves the colors of the vertices.  Given a graph G, we use the notation Phi_k(G) to denote the number of non-equivalent distinguishing colorings of G with at most k colors.
