Here the last sections of all even numbers are superimposed as shells of an onion. In this way many bits of information are saved.", "The table is the head of the last section of partitions of an even integer when it tends to be infinite. Row n lists the parts of the n-th partition that do not contains 1 as a part.", "The shell model of partitions uses this table during the filling mechanism of the head of the last section of the next even integer k. For example, in a mechanical version, the head of the last section (as a mirror) pivoting from vertical to horizontal position. Then a copy of the partitions of the integer k, listed in this table, is transmitted (or reflected) at the head (or mirror) of the last section. Finally the head (or mirror) pivots back to return to its original vertical position. And so on for all even integers.", "In another version, simply a copy of the partitions of the integer k, listed in the table, are placed above the partitions of the last odd number placed in the vertical plane structure.", "It appears this table is useful to know the structure of the partitions of all even integers.
