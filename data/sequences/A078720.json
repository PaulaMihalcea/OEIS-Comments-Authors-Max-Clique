The Collatz function (related to the \"3x+1 problem\") is defined by: f(n) = n/2 if n is even; f(n) = 3n + 1 if n is odd. A famous conjecture states that n, f(n), f(f(n)), .... eventually reaches 1. 2. It appears that a(n) > 0 for all n. The mean of {a(1), a(2), ...., a(N)} seems to be close to 3/2 for large N. That is, there are about 3 even to 2 odd terms in N, f(N), f(f(N)), ...., 1. Hence f1(n) = n/2 will be applied about three times and f2(n) = 3n+1 about two times, in N, f(N), f(f(N)), ...., 1. Heuristically, one can see why 1 must eventually be reached by N, f(N), f(f(N)), ....
