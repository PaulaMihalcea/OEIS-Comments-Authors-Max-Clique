Let us call the result R#(n). It is clear that if m is a value in R#(n), R#(m) is just R#(n) with a different offset. Therefore, unless there is a need to do otherwise, let us denote each sequence by its lowest value. {a(n)} when extended to all integers (the last few unlisted values are ... 36, 61, 45, 34) is R#(34).", "A given sequence c(n) can be one of two kinds. It can either be periodic with c(m) = c(0) for some m, or it can include infinitely many distinct values. R#(n) is finite for all n<34. However, this sequence has been checked up to a(86) = 1091595086717 without reaching 34. Instead it seems to be slowly climbing in value in both the negative and positive directions. Hence, its period is either extremely large or nonexistent (infinite). I conjecture that the latter is the case.
