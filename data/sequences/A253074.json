But take this sequence mod q. Since q does not divide Y, the terms 0, Y, ..., 2qY cover every residue class mod q twice. Therefore, p + kY covers each residue class mod q twice. Consequently, there are two terms congruent to 0 mod q. One can be q, but the other must be a multiple of it (contradicting its primality).", "Essentially the same as A055266. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 13 2015", "Simplified version of the proof: Assume x isn't in the sequence, then eventually all terms must be of the form PRIME - x, else x would appear next. In particular, no multiple of x can appear from there on. Assume k*x is the largest multiple of x in the sequence. Take a prime p not dividing x. Then m*x can't appear in the sequence for k+1 <= m <= k+p, and all terms are eventually of the form PRIME - m*x  for all m in {k+1, ..., k+p}. Take one such term N > p, i.e., N + (k+1)*x, ..., N + (k+p)*x  are all prime. Consider this sequence mod p. Since gcd(x,p)=1, the p terms cover each residue class mod p, so one is a multiple of p, in contradiction with their primality. - _M. F.
