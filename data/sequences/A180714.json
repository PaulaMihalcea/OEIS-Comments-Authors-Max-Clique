The sum of the x- and y-coordinates after n steps (at corners of the spiral) is c(n) = 0, 1, 2, 0, -2, 1, 4, 0, -4, 1, 6, 0, -6, 1, 8, 0, ..., with g.f. -x*(1+x)/( (x-1)*(x^2+1)^2). The current sequence is obtained by recording the sum of the two coordinates at all intermediate positions walking with a stride of 1 along the edges of the spiral, equivalent to showing all interpolating integers between two values of c(n). The first differences a(n+1)-a(n) are two 1's, four -1's, six 1's, eight -1's etc., blocks of +1 and -1 with run lengths increasing by 2. - _R. J.
