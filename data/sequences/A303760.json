This follows by induction on the size of the binary representation of n, and the fact that the \"least possible unused divisor\" part of a greedy rule can find all the unused divisors of A002110(k) before the next larger prime A000040(1+k) is needed as a factor.", "For n >= 1, a((2^k)+1) = A000040(k+1), that is, after the first term with the next larger prime factor, which always occurs at 2^k, the next term is that prime itself, which is prime(k+1).", "(A) For r in range 1 ..

Because we cannot divide prime(k+1) out, as that would give a term already encountered, and because every term in this range has it as a largest prime factor, the relative magnitude-wise order of the terms in this range follows the relative magnitude-wise order of terms in a(0) .. a((2^(k-1))-1).", "(B) For r in range (2^(k-1))+1 ..
