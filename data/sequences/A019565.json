My grounds for this conjecture: any finite cycle in this sequence, if such cycles exist at all, must have at least one member that occurs somewhere in A285319, the terms that seem already to be quite rare. Moreover, any such a number n should satisfy in addition to A019565(n) < n also that A048675^{k}(n) is squarefree, not just for k=0, 1 but for all k >= 0. As there is on average a probability of only 6/(Pi^2) = 0.6079... that any further term encountered on the trajectory of A048675 is squarefree, the total chance that all of them would be squarefree (which is required from the elements of A019565-cycles) is soon minuscule, especially as A048675 is not very tightly bounded (many trajectories seem to skyrocket, at least initially). I am also assuming that usually there is no significant correlation between the binary expansions of n and A048675(n) (apart from their least significant bits), or, for that matter, between their prime factorizations.", "See also the slightly stronger conjecture in A285320, which implies that there would neither be any two-way infinite cycles.", "If either of the conjectures is false (there are cycles), then certainly neither sequence A285332 nor its inverse A285331 can be a permutation of natural numbers. (End)", "The conjecture made in A087207 (see also A288569) implies the two conjectures mentioned above. A further constraint for cycles is that in any A019565-trajectory which starts from a squarefree number (A005117), every other term is of the form 4k+2, while every other term is of the form 6k+3. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 18 2017", "The sequence satisfies the exponential function identity, a(x + y) = a(x) * a(y), whenever x and y do not have a 1-bit in the same position, i.e., when A004198(x,y) = 0.
