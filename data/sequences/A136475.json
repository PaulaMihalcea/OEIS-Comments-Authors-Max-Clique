The motivation for this sequence is to quickly generate integers n such that n divides 2^n+1 (sequences A006521, A136473). From the link, it is known that if 3^k||n with n|2^n+1 and n not a power of 3, then n is divisible by a prime p dividing 2^(3^k)+1. Thus for any fixed k every n with n|2^n+1 not a power of 3 is divisible by one of the following numbers: 3^k or some 3^j.p, where p>3 is a prime in A136475 before the k-th '3' and j is the number of '3's before p in the sequence.", "2.
