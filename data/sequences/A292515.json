Among A078666(14)=64 plane graphs there is 1 pair of isomorphic graphs, namely graphs No. 63 and 64 (hereafter the enumeration of plane graphs from the LinKnot Mathematica package is used, see The Knot Atlas link), hence a(14)=64-1=63. Among 155 plane graphs on 15 vertices, the isomorphic pairs are (143, 149) and (153, 155), hence a(15)=155-2=153. The 11 isomorphic pairs of plane graphs on 16 vertices are: (456, 492), (459, 493), (464, 496), (465, 501), (466, 468), (470, 487), (473, 503), (477, 488), (478, 479), (486, 497), (498, 504).", "Tuzun and Sikora say that such planar graphs constitute the set of 4-edge-connected basic Conway polyhedra, and indeed it suffices to consider any one embedding of each of these graphs into sphere or plane to list all prime knots. However, usually the set of Conway polyhedra is identified with the set of plane graphs instead (see A078666 and references therein), which is necessary to list or encode all prime knot diagrams (on the sphere)."], "link": ["The Knot Atlas, <a href=\"http://katlas.org/wiki/Conway_Notation\">Conway Notation</a>.", "Robert E.
