J. A. Sloane_, Jun 04 2019", "Proof: let b(n) = A096268(n) and c(n) = b(2n+1). For n >= 2, distinct blocks of length 2n are of the form 0_0_...0_ or _0_0..._0, and distinct blocks of length 2n-1 are of the form 0_0_..._0 or _0_0...0_. Therefore, a(2n) is twice the n-subword complexity of {c(k)}, and a(2n-1) is the sum of (n-1)-subword complexity and n-subword complexity of {c(k)}. Note that n-subword complexity of {c(k)} is a(n) because c(2k) = b(4k+1) = 1, c(4k+1) = b(8k+3) = b(2k) = 0 and c(4k+3) = b(8k+7) = b(2k+1) = c(k). In conclusion, a(2n) = 2a(n) and a(2n-1) = a(n-1) + a(n), with a(1) = 2 and a(2) = 3. So a(n) = A005942(n+1)/2. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Feb 27 2020"], "example": ["For n = 1 there are two words {0,1}.", "For n = 2 there are three words {00,01,10}.", "For n = 3 there are five words {000,001,010,100,101}."], "mathematica": ["t = Nest[Flatten[# /. {0 -> {1, 0}, 1 -> {0, 0}}] &, {1}, 12]; Table[2^n - Count[SequencePosition[t, #] & /@ Tuples[{0, 1}, n], {}], {n, 16}] (* _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 19 2016, Version 10.1, after _Robert G.
