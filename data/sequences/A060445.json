A102419).", "The dropping time can be made arbitrarily large: If the starting value is of form n(2^m)-1 and m > 1, the next value is 3n(2^m)-3+1. That divided by 2 is 3n(2^(m-1))-1. It is bigger than the starting value and of the same form - substitute 3n -> n and m-1 -> m, so recursively get an increasing subsequence of m odd values. The dropping time is obviously longer than that. This holds even if Collatz conjecture were refuted. For example, m=5, n=3 -> 95, 286, 143, 430, 215, 646, 323, 970, 485, 1456, 728, 364, 182, 91. So the subsequence in reduced Collatz variant is 95, 143, 215, 323, 485. - _Juhani Heino_, Jul 21 2017"], "link": ["T. D.
