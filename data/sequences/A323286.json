We can choose to map it to any number that can be obtained by the following process. Take any substring d_i, d_{i+1}..., d_j that does not begin with 0. If the number represented by this substring is odd, replace it with twice the number. If it is even either halve it or double it.", "The substring may increase or decrease in length. We do not pad it with zeros if it decreases in length.", "For example, if n = 20129, then by acting on single-digit substrings we get 10129, 40129, 20229, 20119, 20149, 201218. Acting on 2-digit substrings we get in addition 2069 (halve the 12!), 20249, 20158. From 3-digit substrings we also get 40229, 20258; from 4-digit substrings we get 40249; and from 5-digit substrings we get 40258.", "_Eric Angelini_ asks what is the smallest number of steps needed to reach n if we start at 1 and repeatedly apply this process?

A323454) - see proof below.", "Update, Jan 15 2019: Lorenzo Angelini has found that 3 can be reached from 1 in 11 steps: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 112, 56, 28, 14, 12, 6, 3.
