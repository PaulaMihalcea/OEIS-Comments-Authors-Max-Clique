Except for complete graphs, this is the same as vertex-connectivity (A259862).", "There are two ways to define (vertex) connectivity: the minimum size of a vertex cut, and the minimum of the maximum number of internally disjoint paths between two distinct vertices. For non-complete graphs they coincide, which is tremendously useful. For complete graphs with at least 2 vertices, there are no cuts but the second method still works so it is customary to use it to justify the connectivity of K_n being n-1. - _Brendan McKay_, Aug 28 2019."], "link": ["Brendan McKay, <a href=\"http://list.seqfan.eu/pipermail/seqfan/2015-July/015022.html\">confusion over k-connected graphs</a>, posting to Sequence Fans Mailing List, Jul 08 2015."], "example": ["Triangle begins:", "   1", "   0  1", "   1  0  1", "   2  1  0  1", "   5  3  2  0  1", "  13 11  7  2  0  1"], "xref": ["Row sums are A000088.", "Column k = 0 is A000719, if we assume A000719(0) = 1.", "Column k = 1 is A052442, if we assume A052442(1) = 1 and A052442(2) = 0.", "The labeled version is A327125.", "A more standard version (zeros removed) is A259862.", "Cf.
