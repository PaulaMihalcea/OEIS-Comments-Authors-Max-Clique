It is a strong conjecture that all terms of A081145 lie on three roughly straight lines.", "In the first 100000 terms, ignoring the initial three terms, usually we see (2,0,1) repeated many times. Occasionally the pattern will be interrupted when (2,0,1) is followed by one or more copies of (0,1) before the repetitions of (2,0,1) resume.
