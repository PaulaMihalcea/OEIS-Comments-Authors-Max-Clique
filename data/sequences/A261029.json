We use the homogeneity of F(x,y,z) of degree 3. By induction, show that a(8^k) >= k+1. It is evident for k=0. Suppose that it is true for some value of k. Take k+1 triples (x_i,y_i,z_i) such that 8^k = F(x_i, y_i, z_i), i=1,...,k+1. Then for k+1 triples of even numbers (2*x_i, 2*y_i, 2*z_i) we have 8^(k+1) = F(2*x_i, 2*y_i, 2*z_i). But there is always a triple of not all even numbers x=(n-1)/3, y=(n-1)/3, z=(n+2)/3) or x=((n-2)/3, y=(n+1)/3, z=(n+1)/3), where n= 8^(k+1), for which 8^(k+1) = F(x,y,z). So a(8^(k+1)) >= k+2.
