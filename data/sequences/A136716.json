We say the permutation p has an excedance at position i, 1 <= i <= n, if p(2i-1) > i. For example, if we represent permutations in one line notation by the vector (p(1),p(3),...,p(2n-1)) then the permutation (1,3,7,9,5) of O_5 has three excedances in total (at positions 2, 3 and 4).", "This array gives the number of permutations of the set O_n with k excedances. This is the viewpoint taken in [Jansson].

Define a permutation q in S_n to have a descent from odd at position i, 1 <= i <= n-1, if q(i) is odd and q(i) > q(i+1).", "For example, the permutation (2,6,5,3,1,4) in the group S_6 has two descents from odd (at position 3 and position 4). Array A134435 records the number of permutations in S_n with k descents from odd.
