If the number is 1, the convention is taken that the prime factorization is empty, and hence the set of children of 1 is the null set. The formulaic sequence definition given uses pattern matching on n as a product of primes, which is always possible by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The max{...} notation refers to the maximum value of the specified set.", "The sequence differs from A096309 only at a(1) = 0.
