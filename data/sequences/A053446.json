Finally, for a number t divisible by 3, let t* = t/3^s where s is the 3-adic order of t. Let u = u(n) be the n-th number which is not divisible by 3. Consider the following algorithm of the calculating a(n), similar to the algorithm in A002326: Compute successively r_1 = (1 <+> u)*, r_2 = (r_1 <+> u)*, ..., r_h = (r_(h-1) <+> u)* and finish as soon as r_h = 1. Then a(n) = s(1 <+> u) + s(r_1 <+> u) + ... + s(r_(h-1) <+> u).
