Find largest integer s1 such that s1 <= s1_0 and s1 | n. Then let s2_0 = [sqrt(n / s1)]. Find largest integer s2 such that s2 <= s2_0 and s2 | (n / s1). Then s3 = n / (s1 * s2). And minimum surface area a(n) = 2 * (s1 * s2 + s1 * s3 + s2 * s3).", "The above algorithm is not correct. Consider n=68: algorithm returns (s1,s2,s3) = (4,1,17) for minimal surface area 178. However, (2,2,17) has a surface area of 144. Consider n=246: algorithm gives (6,1,41) but (3,2,41) has a lower surface area. It appears that the algorithm, by picking s1 to be the highest divisor of n, does not get the chance to choose a pair (s1,s2) that is equal or nearly equal. I wrote a Python script for a new algorithm (posted below). However, it is much slower since it loops through every divisor s1 of n and divisor s2 of a given n/s1 while finding and keeping a minimum surface area. (Ceiling is used to avoid a floating point error on the roots.) - _Scott B.
