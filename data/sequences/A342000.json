This sequence gives the positions of those points in A329886-tree (Primorial inflation of Doudna-tree) where this ratio doesn't decrease when going downwards (which it mostly does, but see also A342455 for a counterexample). There are 11355 such increasing cases among the first 65536 terms, and 113134 among the first 2^20, although overall, the ratio of such cases on each row k (that has 2^k terms) seem to start decreasing after the seventh row.

This depends on (so far conjectural) observation that (log(A002110(n)) + log(prime(1+n)))^(prime(1+n)) > log(A002110(n))^(1+prime(1+n)) for all n >= 1.", "On the other hand, the leftward branch starting from the left child of the 496th term of the tree appears to contain only ones (corresponding to A342455 from its fifth term onward, see comments there).", "Note that as A329886 is a permutation of A025487, it contains also all terms of A004394 and A004490 in it (see e.g., A342013)."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A342000/b342000.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..65535</a>", "G.
