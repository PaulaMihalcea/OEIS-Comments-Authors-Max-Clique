Same as mu (A008683) except: 0 for even n (A005843) due to square (extended prime) factor (sqrt(2))^2 and rational primes of the form 8k+/-1 (A001132) factor into conjugate (extended prime) pairs (a + b*sqrt(2))(a - b*sqrt(2)), thus contributing +1 to the product instead of -1; e.g., 7 = (3 + sqrt(2))(3 - sqrt(2)).", "For even n a(n) must be 0 because 2 is a square in the quadratic field and so the mu-analog is 0. Of course this coincidentally matches the 0's at even n in A087003. For odd n, from its definition as a product, |a(n)| MUST be the same as that of |mu(n)|. Since from the above we know that A087003(n) is the same as mu(n) at odd n, we can conclude that |a(n)| = |A087003(n)| for all n."], "reference": ["G. H. Hardy and E. M.
