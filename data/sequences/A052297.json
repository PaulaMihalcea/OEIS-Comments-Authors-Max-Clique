Suppose P_(n+1) mod P_i = k; we can write P_(n+1) = m*P_i + k. Setting l = P_(n+1) - P_n, the composite numbers between P_n and P_(n+1) will be consecutively m*P_i + C, where C = k-l+1, k-l+2, ..., k-1. If k < l, there must be a value at which C equals zero since k-1 > 0 and k-l+1 <= 0, so P_i is a factor of a composite number between P_n and P_(n+1). If k >= l, all C values are greater than zero, thus P_i cannot be a factor of a composite number between P_n and P_(n+1). (End)"], "link": ["T. D.
