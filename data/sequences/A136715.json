We say the permutation p has an excedance at position i, 1 <= i <= n, if p(2i) > i. For example, if we represent p in one line notation by the vector (p(2),p(4),...,p(2n)), then the permutation (6,2,8,4,10) of E_5 has three excedances in total (at positions 1, 3 and 5). This array gives the number of permutations of the set E_n with k excedances. This is the viewpoint taken in [Jansson]. See A136716 for the corresponding array when the set E_n is replaced by the set O_n := {1,3,5,...,2n-1}.", "Alternatively, we can work with permutations (p(1),p(2),...,p(n)) in the symmetric group S_n and define p to have a multiplicative 2-excedance at position i, 1 <= i <= n, if 2*p(i) > i. Then the (n,k)-th entry of this array gives the number of permutations in S_n with k multiplicative 2-excedances.
