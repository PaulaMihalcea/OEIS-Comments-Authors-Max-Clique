If k is a factor of n, T(n,k) = (n!/k!)/(n/k)!^k. If n is a multiple of k, we may obtain T(n,k) by arranging all n people in an ordered line, which can be done in n! ways. Peel off the first n/k people for \"group 1\", the next n/k people for \"group 2\", ..., and the last n/k people for \"group k\". Since the k groups are actually unlabeled, we must divide n! by k! Also, since the ordering of the n/k people within each of the k groups is not of importance, we must now divide by (n/k)!^k.
