It becomes more interesting if you apply other periodic correction patterns. What is also interesting that it (and related sequences like 0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,...) was used to cryptanalyze the RC5 block-cipher since it describes the Hamming weight of a difference if at every 3rd step there is no data rotation. Since the attacker has to pay in probability to cause no rotations, the related question was how many corrected Fibonacci sequences with up to m corrections are there. The paper contains a recursive program that enumerates all \"corrected\" Fibonacci sequences of length N, with up to m corrections (in that case we do not restrict the locations of the corrections).", "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 16, 7, 23, 30, 53, ... = Fibonacci with corrections at every 4th step."], "link": ["Vincenzo Librandi, <a href=\"/A092942/b092942.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..1000</a>", "A.
