These are also in the Mathworld link.", "There are several conflicting schemes for extending the dictionary definitions. If we assume that the system of alphabetic names greater than 10^63 defines a word for every power of 1000 and that word comes before \"vigintillion\" alphabetically, the sequence can include all integers. However, many of the extension schemes listed do not meet that standard - some have multiple words and some have words that are alphabetically after \"vigintillion\".", "For the powers of 1000 between 10^66 and 10^303, one source (http://www.mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html) coins the name \"vigintinonillion\" for 10^90, but this format is inconsistent with other names listed in the same source, e.g. \"duovigintillion\", \"sexoctogintillion\". The name \"novemvigintillion\" seems to be more common.
