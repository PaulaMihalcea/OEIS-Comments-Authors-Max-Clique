Since R_n ~ Prime(2n) ~ 2n * (log(2n)+1) ~ 2n * log(2n), whereas A162996(n) ~ Prime(kn) ~ kn * (log(kn)+1) ~ kn * log(kn), giving A162996(n) / R_n ~ k/2 = 2.216/2 = 1.108 which implies an asymptotic overestimate of about 10.8% (a better approximation would need k to depend on n and be asymptotic to 2).
