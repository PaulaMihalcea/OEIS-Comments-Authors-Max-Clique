The present problem was stated as R(45, x) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)))) for x = (1/2)*sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)))). This is equivalent to R(45, 2*sin(Pi/96)) = 2*sin(15*Pi/32). It is a special case of the well known identity R(2*k+1, x) = x*(-1)^k*S(2*k, sqrt(4-x^2)), with the Chebyshev S polynomials (see A049310 for the coefficients). Take k = 22, x = 2*sin(Pi/96), and see the Havil reference, p. 71, for the proof of 2*sin(15*Pi/32) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)))).
