The shape of ABC is given by sidelengths a,b,c, where a=r*b, and c=sqrt(a^2+b^2), where r=(silver ratio)=(1+sqrt(2)).  This is the unique right triangle matching the continued fraction [2,2,2,...] of r; i.e, under the side-partitioning procedure described in the 2007 reference, there are exactly 2 removable subtriangles at each stage.  (This is analogous to the removal of 2 squares at each stage of the partitioning of the silver rectangle as a nest of squares.)", "Archimedes's-like scheme: set p(0) = 1/(2*sqrt(2)), q(0) = 1/3; p(n+1) = 2*p(n)*q(n)/(p(n)+q(n)) (harmonic mean, i.e., 1/p(n+1) = (1/p(n) + 1/q(n))/2), q(n+1) = sqrt(p(n+1)*q(n)) (geometric mean, i.e., log(q(n+1)) = (log(p(n+1)) + log(q(n)))/2), for n >= 0. The error of p(n) and q(n) decreases by a factor of approximately 4 each iteration, i.e., approximately 2 bits are gained by each iteration. Set r(n) = (2*q(n) + p(n))/3, the error decreases by a factor of approximately 16 for each iteration, i.e., approximately 4 bits are gained by each iteration.
