Observe that the m are actually less than k/3. Note that (k-m)/k is also in the Cantor set. If m appears in a row, then 3m does also. Let A and B be the first and last numbers in row n, then it appears that k = A + 3B. This implies A = k (mod 3). The interesting graph of this triangle shows that some ranges of m are not allowed.", "When k is a prime of the form (3^r-1)/2, then the row consists of the 2^(r-1)-1 numbers (greater than 0) whose base-3 representation consists of only 0's and 1's.
