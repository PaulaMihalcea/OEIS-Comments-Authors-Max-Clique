The minimal length path to the nearest power of 2 (= 2^A064415(n)) is realized whenever one uses any of the A005087(k) distinct odd prime factors of the current k, at any step of the process. For example, this could be done by iterating with the map k -> k-(k/A078701(k)), i.e., by using the least odd prime factor of k (instead of the largest prime).", "Proof: Viewing the prime factorization of changing k as a multiset (\"bag\") of primes, we see that liquefying any odd prime p with step p -> (p-1) brings at least one more 2 to the bag, while applying p -> (p-1) to any 2 just removes it from the bag, but gives nothing back. Thus the largest (and thus also the nearest) power of 2 is reached by eliminating - step by step - all odd primes from the bag, but none of 2's, and it doesn't matter in which order this is done.", "The above implies also that the sequence is totally additive, which also follows because both A064097 and A064415 are.
