This is because prime(181)/181 > 6 for the first time. In general this sequence is determined by prime(n)/n: the pattern for each row of the triangle is that it ends with prime(n), preceded by multiples of k = prime(n)/n down to k^2, then the largest multiple of k-1 less than k^2 and the largest multiple of k-2 less than that and so on.
