Vertices in the graph must map onto lattice points, and of course must preserve the incidence structure of the graph. A square in the lattice may have both diagonals present - their intersection does not count as an incidence.", "Configurations differing only a rotation or reflection are not counted as different.", "The resulting figures are variously called 'polysticks', 'polyedges' or 'polyforms'."], "link": ["N.
