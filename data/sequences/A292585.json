The actual run lengths can be read from the exponents of primes in the prime factorization of A278222(A292385(m)), where m = min_{k=1..n} for which a(k) = a(n).

Of these numbers, 5 and 1 are of the form 4k+1, while others are not, thus there are two separate runs of length 1: [1, 1]. On the other hand, when traversing from 9 as 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, again only two terms are of the form 4k+1: 9 and 1 and they are not next to each other, so we have the same two runs of one each: [1, 1]. Similarly for n = 7, and n = 10 as neither in path 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 nor in path 10 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 are any more 4k+1 terms (compared to the path beginning from 5). Thus a(5), a(7), a(9) and a(10) are all allotted the same value by the restricted growth sequence transform, which in this case is 3.  Note that 3 occurs in this sequence for the first time at n=5, with A292385(5) = 5 and A278222(5) = 6 = 2^1 * 3^1, where those run lengths 1 and 1 are the prime exponents of 6."], "program": ["(PARI)", "allocatemem(2^30);", "rgs_transform(invec) = { my(om = Map(), outvec = vector(length(invec)), u=1); for(i=1, length(invec), if(mapisdefined(om,invec[i]), my(pp = mapget(om, invec[i])); outvec[i] = outvec[pp] , mapput(om,invec[i],i); outvec[i] = u; u++ )); outvec; };", "write_to_bfile(start_offset,vec,bfilename) = { for(n=1, length(vec), write(bfilename, (n+start_offset)-1, \" \", vec[n])); }", "A005940(n) = { my(p=2, t=1); n--; until(!n\\=2, if((n%2), (t*=p), p=nextprime(p+1))); t }; \\\\ Modified from code of _M.
