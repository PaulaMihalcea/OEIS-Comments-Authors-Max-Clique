For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100)."], "example": ["Triangle begins:", "   1: (1)       21: (221)      41: (51)       61: (51)", "   2: (2)       22: (23)       42: (222)      62: (6)", "   3: (11)      23: (2111)     43: (2211)     63: (111111)", "   4: (3)       24: (5)        44: (24)       64: (7)", "   5: (21)      25: (41)       45: (231)      65: (61)", "   6: (3)       26: (5)        46: (24)       66: (52)", "   7: (111)     27: (311)      47: (21111)    67: (511)", "   8: (4)       28: (5)        48: (6)        68: (43)", "   9: (31)      29: (41)       49: (51)       69: (421)", "  10: (22)      30: (5)        50: (6)        70: (43)", "  11: (211)     31: (11111)    51: (411)      71: (4111)", "  12: (4)       32: (6)        52: (6)        72: (7)", "  13: (31)      33: (51)       53: (51)       73: (331)", "  14: (4)       34: (42)       54: (33)       74: (322)", "  15: (1111)    35: (411)      55: (3111)     75: (3211)", "  16: (5)       36: (33)       56: (6)        76: (34)", "  17: (41)      37: (321)      57: (51)       77: (331)", "  18: (32)      38: (33)       58: (6)        78: (34)", "  19: (311)     39: (3111)     59: (411)      79: (31111)", "  20: (5)       40: (6)        60: (6)        80: (7)", "For example, 45 has binary expansion (101101), with co-Lyndon factorization (10)(110)(1), so row n = 45 is (2,3,1)."], "mathematica": ["colynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]]@Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]];", "Table[Length/@colynfac[If[n==0,{},IntegerDigits[n,2]]],{n,30}]"], "xref": ["Row lengths are A329312.", "Row sums are A070939.", "Positions of rows of length 1 are A275692.", "The non-\"co\" version is A329314.", "Binary co-Lyndon words are counted by A001037 and ranked by A329318.", "Cf.
