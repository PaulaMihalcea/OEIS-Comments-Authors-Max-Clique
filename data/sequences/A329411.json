It is easy to prove that this is always possible in the first case (1 prime required). In the second case, we must find two larger primes at given distance |a(n-1) - a(n-2)|, necessarily even, since a(n-3) + P(n) contains two primes. To have this infinitely many times, the twin prime conjecture or a variant thereof must hold. However, the sequence need not be computable in greedy manner! That is, if ever for given P(n) (with composite sum) no a(n) would exist such that a(n) + P(n) contains 2 primes, this simply means that the considered value of a(n-1) was incorrect, and the next larger choice has to be made. Given this freedom, there is no doubt about well-definedness of this sequence up to infinity. - _M. F.
