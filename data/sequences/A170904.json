[_Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 02 2010]", "A combinatorial argument, valid for n >= 2, leads to Touchard's formula for the n-th menage number, U(n), a formula which involves the coefficients of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. It is combinatorially reasonable to take U(0) = 1 and U(1) = 0, leading to A335700, but taking the connection with Chebyshev polynomials seriously instead gives U(0) = 2 and U(1) = -1, leading to A102761. Riordan derives equation (30) on page 205 for the number of reduced three-line Latin rectangles (A000186) by making use of product identities on Chebyshev polynomials, and therefore requires the second definition; it also requires extending the definition of menage numbers to negative index. Riordan then obtains equation (30a) on page 206 by eliminating the negative indices and redefining U(0) to be 1 (which leads to A000179). A170904 (this sequence) is what is obtained by mistakenly using A335700 instead of A000179 in Riordan's equation (30a). - _William P. Orrick_, Aug 11 2020"], "reference": ["J.
