We do a short survey of their known properties and explain some new algorithms that allow their efficient enumeration. Using this we give the symmetry groups of all i-hedrites and the minimal representative for each. We also review the link of 4-hedrites with knot theory and the classification of 4-hedrites with simple central circuits. An i-self-hedrite is a self-dual plane graph with faces and vertices of size/degree 2, 3 and 4. We give a new efficient algorithm for enumerating them based on i-hedrites. We give a classification of their possible symmetry groups and a classification of 4-self-hedrites of symmetry T, Td in terms of the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. Then we give a method for enumerating 4-self-hedrites with simple zigzags.", "Is this the same as A145393 alternating with zeros? - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jul 05 2017"], "link": ["Mathieu Dutour Sikiric, Michel Deza, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5323\">4-regular and self-dual analogs of fullerenes</a>, arXiv:0910.5323 [math.GT], 2009."], "example": ["Although these terms alternate 0 and nonzero, this format should be kept, against normal OEIS formatting, to stay analogous to the related sequences."], "xref": ["Cf.
