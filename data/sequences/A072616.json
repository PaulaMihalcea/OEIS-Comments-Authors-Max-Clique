Note that a(2)=1 because the two solutions are essentially the same. The number of solutions is the same for odd or even numbers in order because a solution having the odd numbers in order can be converted to a solution having even numbers in order by subtracting 1 from even numbers and adding 1 to odd numbers. For example, {1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 10} becomes {2, 1, 4, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3, 10, 9}. Is the number of solutions always positive?
