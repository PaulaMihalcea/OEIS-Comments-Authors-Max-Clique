Proof: The sequence cannot contain three consecutive primes. So at least one term in three is composite. QED", "3. For any prime p, there is a term that is divisible by p. Proof: Suppose not. (i) No prime q > p can divide any term. For if a(n)=kq is the first multiple of q to appear, then we could have used kp < kq instead, a contradiction. So every term a(n) is a product of primes < p. (ii) Choose N such that a(n) > p^2 for all n > N. For n > N, let a(n)=bg, a(n+1)=c, a(n+2)=dg, where g=gcd(a(n),a(n+2)). Let q be the largest prime factor of g.

The first of these curves consists of most of the odd terms in the sequence. The second family consists of the primes (c=1), even terms (c=2), and c*prime (c=3,5,7,11,13,...).
