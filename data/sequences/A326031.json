We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets of positive integers has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, it follows that the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. The weight of a set-system is the sum of sizes of its elements (sometimes called its edges)."], "formula": ["a(2^x + ... + 2^z) = w(x + 1) + ... + w(z + 1), where x...z are distinct nonnegative integers and w = A000120.
