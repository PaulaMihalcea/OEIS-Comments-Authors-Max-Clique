Proof: Define m(0):=1, m(1):=2 and m(n+1):=8*m(n)+2 for n>0. This results in m(n)=2*sum_{j=0..n-1} 8^j = 2*(8^n - 1)/7 or m(n)=1, 2, 22, 222, 2222, 22222, \u2026, (in base-8) for n=0,1,2,3,\u2026. Evidently, for n>0 m(n) has n 2\u2019s and these are the only prime substrings in base-8 representation.
