I conjecture that there is an increasing number of pwn with, e.g., p=nextprime(2^(k+1)). Also, if 2^k p q and 2^k p' q are both weird, then usually 2^k p\" q is weird for all p\" between p and p'. There is one exception [p, p', q] = [2713, 2729, 8191] for k=10, five exceptions [6197, 6203, 12049], [6113, 6131, 12289], [6113, 6131, 12301], [6121, 6133, 12323], [5441, 5449, 16411] for k=11, and seven exceptions for k=12. These exceptions occur when q/p is close to an integer, (p, q) ~ (3/4, 3/2)*2^(k+2) or (2/3, 2)*2^(k+2). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 16 2016"], "link": ["Douglas E.
