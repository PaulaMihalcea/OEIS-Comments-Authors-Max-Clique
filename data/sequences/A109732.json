This seems very likely.", "From _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 28 2015: (Start)", "The question of whether every odd number is present in this sequence can be reformulated as follows. Can every odd number m be transformed into 1 using the maps: m -> (m-1)/2 (only if the result is integer) and m -> 3m, applied in some order? It is clear that even numbers cannot appear in such a transformation, since they would remain even and thus not reach 1.", "Replacing m by n = (m+1)/2, we get an equivalent question: Can any number n be transformed into 1 using the maps: n -> n/2 (only if n is even) and n -> 3n-1 applied in some order?", "An affirmative answer to this question would follow from the 3x-1 variation of Collatz conjecture. This states that the maps x -> x/2 (for even x) and x -> 3x-1 (for odd x) eventually reach one of the three cycles: (1,2), (5, ...) of length 5 -- see A003079 -- or (17, ...) of length 17 -- see A003124.", "However, in our problem, we have the freedom of choosing either of the two maps at each stage (the only restriction being that n -> n/2 can be used only if n is even). With this freedom, we can transform 5 and 17 from the nontrivial cycles of the 3x-1 problem to 1: (5, 14, 7, 20, 10, 29, 86, 43, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)  or (17, 50, 25, 74, 37, 110, 55, 164, 82, 41, 122, 61, 182, 91, 272, 136, 68, 203, 608, 304, 152, 76, 38, 19, 56, 28, 14, ... as before).", "That is, under the 3x-1 variation of Collatz conjecture, we can transform any number either to 1, 5, or 17, and in the latter two cases we can proceed further as explained above and still reach 1.
