In February 2020 the following three bounds and formulas arrived. They are listed in chronological order.  Here k = k(n) denotes the smallest number such that T(n)+T(k) is a triangular number T(m) for some m = m(n). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 22 2020", "k = T(n) - 1 is an upper bound on k(n) = a(n). For T(k) makes a huge triangle; all the elements of the T(n) triangle can be thinly plated onto the side of the big one as a single additional row, producing T(k+1) with m = k+1. - _Allan C.

Then T(n) is the sum of Q consecutive integers, the last Q rows of the triangle T(m) with m = T(n)/Q + (Q-1)/2, giving the upper bound k <= T(n)/Q - (Q+1)/2. [This bound is now A332554, the values of Q are in A332547.] This bound is not tight: for n=9 it gives a(9) <= 6 when in fact a(9) = 4. - _Michael J. Collins_, Feb 19 2020", "Comments from Richard C.
