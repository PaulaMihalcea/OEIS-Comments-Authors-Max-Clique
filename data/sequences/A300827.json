Question: are there any other cases where a(x) = a(y), with x < y ?", "The reason why this is not equal to A297169: Even though A297112 contains only powers of two after the initial zero, as A297112(n) = 2^A033265(A156552(d)) for n > 1, and A297168(n) is computed as Sum_{d|n, d<n} A297112(d), still a single 1-bit in binary expansion of A297168(n) might be formed as a sum of several terms of A297112(d), i.e., could be born of carries.", "From _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 28 2019: (Start)", "  A297168(n) = Sum_{d|n, d<n} A297112(d) will not produce any carries (in base-2) if and only if n is a power of prime. Only in that case the number of summands (A000005(n)-1) is equal to the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity, A001222(n) = A000120(A156552(n)). (A notable subset of such numbers is A324201, numbers that are mapped to even perfect numbers by A156552). Precisely because there are so few points with duplicate values (apart from primes), this sequence is not particularly good for filtering other sequences, because the number of false positives is high. Any of the related sequences like A324203, A324196, A324197 or A324181 might work better in that respect.
