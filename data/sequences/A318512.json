Define sequence Ay(n) as the denominator of function s(n), with otherwise similar definition, but with A064549 in place of A000290. Let Ay(n) be the denominator of s(n), reduced also into the lowest terms. (Corresponding numerators are A318649 and A318511 respectively.

As A318511/Ay is given in the lowest terms (not both of A318511(n) and Ay(n) can be even at same n), this implies that Ay must indeed be identical to A318512, and furthermore that A318655(n) = A007814(A318649(n)) = A007814(A318511(n)).", "(End)"], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A318512/b318512.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..16384</a>", "Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_convolution\">Dirichlet convolution</a>"], "formula": ["a(n) = denominator of f(n), where f(1) = 1, f(n) = (1/2) * (A000290(n) - Sum_{d|n, d>1, d<n} f(d) * f(n/d)) for n > 1.
