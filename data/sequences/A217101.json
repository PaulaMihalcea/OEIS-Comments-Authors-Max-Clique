Proof: For even n we have A206925(A206927(n/2)) = 2*(n/2) = n. For n=1,3,7,9 we get A206925(k)=n if we set k=1,3,8,17. For odd n>10 we define b(n) := 14*2^((n-9)/2)+A206927((n-9)/2). The b(n) have the binary expansion 11110, 111100, 1111001, 11110010, 111100101, 1111001011, 11110010110, 111100101100, 1111001011001, 11110010110010, 111100101100101, \u2026 ,for n=11, 13, 15, 17, \u2026 . Evidently, b(n) is constructed by the concatenation of 111 with repeated bit patterns of 100101 (=37) truncated to 4+(n-9)/2 digits. As an effect the number of contiguous palindromic bit patterns of b(n) is A206925(111_2)+3+A206925(A206927((n-9)/2)) = 6+3+n-9 = n. This proves that there is always a number with n contiguous palindromic bit patterns.", "a(5)=0, and this is the only zero term. Proof: The inequality A206925(n) >= 2*floor(log_2(n)) (cf. A206925) implies A206925(n) > 5 for n>=8. By direct search we find A206925(n)<>5 for n=1..7.
