The highest cluster of row n is just the number 2^n, the trajectory to 1 of which has n-1 downs and no ups. The second highest cluster of row n consists of the numbers T(n, k_n - r) = 4^(r - 1) * t(n - 2*r + 2) for 1 <= r <= (n - 3) / 2, where t(k) = (2^k - (-1)^k - 3) / 6. These have n-2 downs and one up.
