If we only allow rotations and reflections that preserve the parent (square) lattice, we get A145393; the first discrepancy is at n = 25 (see illustration), the second is at n = 30. If both restrictions are applied, i.e., only rotations preserving the parent lattice are allowed, we get A145392. The analog for the hexagonal lattice is A300651. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Mar 12 2018"], "link": ["Andrey Zabolotskiy, <a href=\"/A054346/b054346.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..1000</a>", "John S.
