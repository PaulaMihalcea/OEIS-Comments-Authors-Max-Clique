Because such (new) \"doom divisors\" are born only in the \"wild part\" of the arithmetic derivative (i.e., what is left after A003557(n) has been divided out of the derivative of n), it follows that when the derivative is applied to terms of A276086 (that do not contain any doom divisors), the count of such divisors in the result must be equal to that for A342002(n).", "Positions of the records (and the first occurrence of each n) start as: 1, 8, 1164, 18675300, ..."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A342019/b342019.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..65537</a>", "Victor Ufnarovski and Bo \u00c5hlander, <a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL6/Ufnarovski/ufnarovski.html\">How to Differentiate a Number</a>, J.
