T(n,k) is the number of permutations on [n] with k big descents. The mean number of big descents in permutations on [n] is (n-1)(n-2)/(2n).

(A recursive tree on n vertices is a rooted tree with the vertices labeled 1, 2, ... n, such that the root is labeled 1 and every path starting at the root is increasing with respect to the labels.) - Taral Guldahl Seierstad (seiersta(AT)informatik.hu-berlin.de), Oct 12 2006", "In the comment by T. G. Seierstad, the term \"leaf\" means \"vertex incident with exactly one edge.\" Thus if the root has only one child, the root is a leaf.

For example, T(3,0) = 4 counts {0->1->2->3}, {0->1->3->2}, {0->2->3->1}, {0->3->2->1} and T(3,1) = 2 counts {0->2->1,2->3}, {0->3->1,3->2} (the arrows indicate edges directed away from the root). - _David Callan_, Feb 01 2007", "Contribution from _Peter Bala_, Sep 19 2008: (Start)", "If we divide the entries of this array by 2 and then read the rows in reverse order we obtain the array of 2-restricted Eulerian numbers A144696.", "Two equivalent interpretations of this array are:", "A) Define a permutation p in the symmetric group S_n to have an r-excedance at position i, 1 <= i <= n-1, if p(i) >= i+r. This array gives the number of permutations in the symmetric group S_n having k 2-excedances (see the last chapter of [Riordan]). For example, in the symmetric group S_3, the two permutations (3,1,2) and (3,2,1) have a single 2-excedance, while the remaining four permutations have no 2-excedances. Hence T(3,0) = 4 and T(3,1) = 2.
