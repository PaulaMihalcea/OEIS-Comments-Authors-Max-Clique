The numbers in row n are the widths of the segments in the parts of the symmetric representation of sigma(n). Each new subpart in a segment (in the left half) of row n starts at the same odd index that represents an odd divisor d of n in the irregular triangle of A237048. Either a subpart ends at an even index e, representing a second odd divisor, which satisfies d * e = oddpart(n), and thus the entire subpart is duplicated in the symmetric portion of the representation, or a subpart runs through the center and continues contiguously into the right half of the symmetric portion of the representation. In other words, the number of subparts in row n equals the number of odd divisors of n, i.e., the conjecture is true.
