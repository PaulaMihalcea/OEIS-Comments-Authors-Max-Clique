Van der Pauw generalized Lampard's results with the formula exp(-4*Pi^2*Cab,cd) + exp(-4*Pi^2*Cbc,da) = 1, see the links. Van der Pauw observed that in Lampard's case of symmetry, the two capacitances Cab,cd and Cbc,da are mutually equal, and hence are both equal to C = log(2)/(4*Pi^2) independently of the size or shape of the cross-section, which is Lampard's theorem.", "Lampard's constant is closely related to Van der Pauw's constant A163973.", "This constant was named after the Australian professor of electrical engineering Douglas Geoffrey Lampard (1927 - 1994). - _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 03 2020"], "link": ["D.
