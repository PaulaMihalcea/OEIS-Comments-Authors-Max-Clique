Proof: If we accept that x is not an integer, then we can see that x is not rational. For if it were, x^2 would be as well, whereas 2^x would not be (because 2 is not a perfect power). Thus we would have a contradiction (since x^2 = 2^x). Similarly, if x were irrational algebraic, x^2 would be as well, while 2^x would be transcendental (by the Gelfond-Schneider theorem). Thus the only conclusion is that x is transcendental. - _Chayim Lowen_, Aug 13 2015"], "reference": ["\"Angela\" (R. J.
