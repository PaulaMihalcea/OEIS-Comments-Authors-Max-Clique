Following Gould (1999, p. 135), define the elementary symmetric polynomials e_1^{(N)}, e^2^{(N)}, ..., e_N^{(N)}, where e_j^{(N)} is the sum of all products of x_1, x_2, ..., x_N taken j at a time.", "Since N <= n, without loss of generality, we may assume we have the extra variables x_{N+1}, ..., x_n, define e_1^{(n)}, e_2^{(n)}, ..., e_N^{(n)}, e_{N+1}^{(n)}, ..., e_n^{(n)}, and then set x_{N+1} = x_{N+2} = ... = x_n = 0. In such a case, we get e_j^{(N)} = e_j^{(n)} for j = 1..N, and e_j^{(n)} = 0 for j = (N+1)..n. Thus, we may drop the superscripts N and n on power sum and on the elementary symmetric polynomials and write S_n, and e_1, e_2, ..., e_n with the understanding that e_{N+1} = ... = e_n = 0.

Here c(t_1,t_2,...,t_n) = n * (-1)^(t_2 + t_4 + ... + t_{2*floor(n/2)}) * (t_1 + ... + t_n - 1)!/(t_1!*...*t_n!).", "Given a partition (t_1,...,t_n) of n (as defined above), we may use only those j's in {1,...,n} for which t_j > 0 and write the partition in the usual notation by repeating each such j t_j times (and place these j's in a non-descending order). E.g., the partition 1*3 + 2*1 + 3*0 + 4*0 + 5*0 of 5 can be written as [1,1,1,2].
