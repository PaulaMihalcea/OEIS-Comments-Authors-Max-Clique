For example, the Lyndon product of (231) with (213) is (232131), the product of (221) with (213) is (222131), and the product of (122) with (2121) is (2122121). A Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the Lyndon product. Equivalently, a Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly less than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in lexicographically decreasing order, their concatenation is equal to their Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted Lyndon factorization (001)(1).", "It appears that some numbers (such as 10) never appear in the sequence."], "example": ["Triangle begins:", "   1: (1)", "   2: (1,1)", "   3: (1,1,1)", "   4: (3,1)", "   5: (4,1)", "   6: (1,4,1)", "   7: (2,4,1)", "   8: (1,2,4,1)", "   9: (1,1,2,4,1)", "  10: (3,2,4,1)", "  11: (1,3,2,4,1)", "  12: (1,1,3,2,4,1)", "  13: (3,3,2,4,1)", "  14: (9,4,1)", "  15: (1,9,4,1)", "  16: (2,9,4,1)", "  17: (16,1)", "  18: (1,16,1)", "  19: (1,1,16,1)", "  20: (3,16,1)", "For example, the reversed first 13 terms of A000002 are (1221221211221), with Lyndon factorization (122)(122)(12)(1122)(1), so row 13 is (3,3,2,4,1)."], "mathematica": ["lynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{q,RotateRight[q,#]}]=={q,RotateRight[q,#]}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "lynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[lynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]][Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],lynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]]];", "kolagrow[q_]:=If[Length[q]<2,Take[{1,2},Length[q]+1],Append[q,Switch[{q[[Length[Split[q]]]],q[[-2]],Last[q]},{1,1,1},0,{1,1,2},1,{1,2,1},2,{1,2,2},0,{2,1,1},2,{2,1,2},2,{2,2,1},1,{2,2,2},1]]]", "kol[n_Integer]:=Nest[kolagrow,{1},n-1];", "Table[Length/@lynfac[Reverse[kol[n]]],{n,100}]"], "xref": ["Row lengths are A329317.", "The non-reversed version is A329315.", "Cf.
