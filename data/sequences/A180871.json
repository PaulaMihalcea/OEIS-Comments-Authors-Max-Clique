The Mathematica program computes both the primes in A007996 and the terms in this sequence. Using modular arithmetic, it is easy to see that if prime p divides A000058(k) for some k, then we must have k < p. In practice, k < 5*sqrt(p).", "An open problem is to prove that all terms of Sylvester's sequence are squarefree or to find a counterexample.
