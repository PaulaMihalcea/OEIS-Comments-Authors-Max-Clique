Thus these have the set of divisors of c and at least one semidivisor p^2. For squareful c that are not prime powers, p^2 may divide c, but p^3 does not. The minimum squareful c = 12, 2^3 does not divide 12 yet is less than 12 and is a product of the minimum prime divisor of 12. All other even squareful c admit a power of 2 that does not divide c, since there must be another prime divisor q > 2.
