A hex tree is a rooted tree where each vertex has 0, 1, or 2 children and, when only one child is present, it is either a left child, or a median child, or a right child (name due to an obvious bijection with certain tree-like polyhexes; see the Harary-Read paper).", "Also, with offset 1, triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of skew Dyck paths of semilength n and having k left steps (n >= 1; 0 <= k <= n-1). A skew Dyck path is a path in the first quadrant which begins at the origin, ends on the x-axis, consists of steps U=(1,1)(up), D=(1,-1)(down) and L=(-1,-1)(left) so that up and left steps do not overlap. The length of a path is defined to be the number of its steps.
