Proof: we restrict ourselves on a(n)>0 (the case a(n)=0 is trivial). Let T(i), 1<=i<=a(n), be the a(n) different sums of squares of primes representing n. Then, adding p^2 to those expressions, we get a(n) sums of squares of primes T(i)+p^2, obviously representing n+p^2, thus a(n+p^2) cannot be less than a(n).", "Second statement of monotony: a(n+m)>=max(a(n),a(m)) for all m with a(m)>1. Proof: let T(i), 1<=i<=a(n), be the a(n) different sums of squares of primes representing n; let S(i), 1<=i<=a(m), be the a(m) different sums of squares of primes representing m. Then, adding these expressions, we get a(n) sums of squares of primes T(i)+S(1), representing n+m, further we get a(m) sums T(1)+S(i), also representing n+m. Thus a(n+m) cannot be less than the maximum of a(n) and a(m).", "The minimum b(k):=min( n | a(j)>k for all j>n) exists for all k>=0. See A134755 for that sequence representing b(k).
