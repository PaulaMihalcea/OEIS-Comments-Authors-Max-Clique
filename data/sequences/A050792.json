Any number of solutions to the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1 can be produced through the use of the algebraic identity (9t^3+1)^3 + (9t^4)^3 + (-9t^4-3t)^3 = 1 by substituting in values of t. ...", "\"Although these are certainly solutions, the identity generates only one family of solutions. Other solutions such as (94, 64, -103), (235, 135, -249), (438, 334, -495), ... can be found. What is not known is if it is possible to parameterize all solutions for this equation. Put another way, are there an infinite number of families of solutions? Probable yes, but that too remains to be shown.\" [Herkommer]", "Values of x associated with A050794."], "reference": ["Mark A.
