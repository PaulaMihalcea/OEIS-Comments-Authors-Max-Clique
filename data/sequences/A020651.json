Fibonacci numbers occur at the right edge this tree, i.e., a(A000225(n)) = A000045(n+1).

Suppose that a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h are complex numbers. Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules: (1) 1 is in S; (2) if x is in S and cx+d is not 0, then U(x) = (ax+b)/(cx+d) is in S; (3) if x is in S and gx+h is not 0, then D(x) = (ex+f)/(gx+h) is in S. If an infinite path in the resulting tree has convergent nodes, then there is some node after which the path is \"updown zigzag\" ((UoD)o(UoD)o ...) or \"downup zigzag\" (DoU)o(DoU)o ...). If ag+ch is not 0, then the updown zigzag limit is invariant of x and equals [ae + cf - bg - dh + sqrt(X)]/(2(ag + ch)), where X = (ae + cf - bg - dh)^2 + 4(be + df + ag + ch). If ce + dg is not 0, then the downup zigzag limit is invariant of x and equals [ae + bg - cf - dh + sqrt(Y)]/(2(ce + dg)), where Y = (ae + bg - cf - dh)^2 + 4(af + bh)(ce + dg)) = X. Thus, for the tree A020651, the updown zigzag limit is -1 + sqrt(2) and the downup zigzag limit, sqrt(2). - _Clark Kimberling_, Nov 10 2013", "From _Yosu Yurramendi_, Jul 13 2014: (Start)", "If the terms (n > 0) are written as an array (left-aligned fashion) with rows of length 2^m, m = 0,1,2,3,...", "1,", "1,2,", "1,3,2,3,", "1,4,3,4,2,5,3,5,", "1,5,4,5,3,7,4,7,2, 7,5, 7,3, 8,5, 8,", "1,6,5,6,4,9,5,9,3,10,7,10,4,11,7,11,2,9,7,9,5,12,7,12,3,11,8,11,5,13,8,13,", "then the sum of the m-th row is 3^m (m = 0,1,2,), and each column is an arithmetic sequence.
