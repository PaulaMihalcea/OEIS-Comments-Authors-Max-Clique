Apart from the initial \"3\", one always has either \"6-4\" (i.e., a 6 followed by a 4), or else \"5-5\". The 6-4's always come either alone (6-4) or triply (6-4, 6-4, 6-4), while the 5-5's always come alone. So if we let \"6-4, 5-5\" be represented by the numeral \"1\", and \"6-4, 6-4, 6-4, 5-5\" by the numeral \"3\", then the sequence of first differences, in this compressed code, is A080426, which itself is defined by a simple substitution rule. - D.
