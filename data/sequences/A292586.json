Thus all the runs are separate runs of length one, from which follows that A278222 when applied to A292382 yields only primorials. Moreover, the steps producing 4k+2 numbers are also only steps in A005940 that add new distinct prime factors to the generated number. Thus the total number of such steps is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of the eventual n. Hence A278222(A292382(n)) = A002110(A001221(n))."], "link": ["Antti Karttunen, <a href=\"/A292586/b292586.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..16384</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Pri#primorial_numbers\">Index entries for sequences related to primorial numbers</a>"], "formula": ["a(n) = A002110(A001221(n)).", "a(n) = A278222(A292382(n)).", "For all n >= 1:", "A001221(n) = A001221(a(n)) = A001222(a(n)) = A000120(A292382(n))."], "mathematica": ["Array[Product[Prime@ i, {i, PrimeNu@ #}] &, 105] (* _Michael De Vlieger_, Sep 25 2017 *)"], "program": ["(PARI) A292586(n) = prod(i=1, omega(n), prime(i));", "(Scheme)", "(define (A292586 n) (A002110 (A001221 n)))", "(define (A292586 n) (A278222 (A292382 n)))"], "xref": ["Cf.
