The two maps phi_a and phi_b are commuting bijections on {a,b}, exactly as in the Example on page 85 of \"Iteration of maps by an automaton\". It follows as in that example that (a(n)) is generated by the projection of a fixed point of a substitution on an alphabet of 8 letters, and a simple computation as on that page yields the morphism eta.
