The solutions with positive and negative indices k form mutually conjugate pairs, such as z_3 and z_-3. A similar situation arises also for the related fixed points of the mapping -exp(z). My link explains why is it convenient to use odd indices for the fixed points of +exp(z) and even indices for those of -exp(z). Setting K = sign(k)*floor(|k|/2), an odd-indexed z_k is also a fixed point of the logarithmic function in its K-th branch, i.e., a solution of z = log(z)+2*Pi*K*i. Moreover, an odd-indexed z_k equals -W_L(-1), where W_L is the L-th branch of the Lambert W function, with L = -floor((k+1)/2). For any K, the mapping M_K(z) = log(z)+2*Pi*K*i has z_k as its unique attractor, convergent from any nonzero point in C (an exception occurs for K=0, for which M_0(z) has two attractors, z_1 and z_-1, as described in my linked document).", "The value listed here is the real part of z_3 = a + i*A277682."], "link": ["Stanislav Sykora, <a href=\"/A277681/b277681.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..2000</a>", "S.
