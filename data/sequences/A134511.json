But A049310(n,r) = 0 when n + r is odd and A128174(r,n-k) = 1 iff r + n - k is even. Thus, when k is odd, T(n, n-k) = 0.", "Assume now k is even.

Letting m = n-r (which is even), we see that the summation ranges from m = 0 to k over even numbers. Thus, let s = m/2, and so T(n, n-k) = Sum_{s = 0 .. k/2} binomial(n-s, n-2*s) = Sum_{s = 0 .. k/2} binomial(n-s, s) = F(n+1, k/2), where F(.,.) is the incomplete Fibonacci number from the references (see also the Formula section below).", "(End)"], "link": ["Robert Israel, <a href=\"/A134511/b134511.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..10010</a> (rows 0 to 141, flattened)", "H.
