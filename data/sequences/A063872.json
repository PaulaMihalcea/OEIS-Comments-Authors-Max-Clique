Let k be the product of the distinct prime factors of m. Then phi(m)/m = phi(k)/k, so k/(k-phi(k)) = m/(m-phi(m)) is an integer. Thus k is divisible by k-phi(k) and k is squarefree. Let k-phi(k) = d and k/(k-phi(k)) = e; note that e>1 and GCD(d,e)=1. Thus d = k - phi(k) = d e - phi(d e) = d e - phi(d) phi(e) so d (e-1) = d e - d = phi(d) phi(e) <= phi(d) (e-1) and d <= phi(d). But this implies that d=1, so phi(k)=k-1 and k is prime. Hence m is a prime power. - _Dean Hickerson_, Aug 28 2001", "For primes, quotient = (p - 1) / 1 = p - 1; for prime powers, p^a, a > 1: quotient = p^(a - 1)(p - 1) / p^(a - 1) = p - 1, so each p - 1 values occur infinitely often: a(n) + 1 = root of n-th prime power with positive exponent, i.e., A025473(n+1). - [Edited by] _Daniel Forgues_, May 08 2014", "\"LCM numeral system\": a(n+1) is maximum digit for index n, n >= 0; a(-n) is maximum digit for index n, n < 0. - _Daniel Forgues_, May 03 2014"], "link": ["Harvey P.
