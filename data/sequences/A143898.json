This value of K was found using exact interval arithmetic. For each n <= 110 and for each prime p in the range n to n^1.7, we computed an interval k(n,p) such that p is between n^k(n,p) and (n+1)^k(n,p). The intersection of all these intervals produces a list of intervals. The least value in those intervals is K, which is log(1151)/log(95). We computed 10^5 terms of this sequence to give us confidence that a(n)>0 for all n.", "More details about the algorithm: The n^1.7 limit was chosen because we were fairly certain that K would be less than 1.7. Let k(n) be the union of the intervals k(n,p) for p<n^1.7. Then k(n) is the set of exponents e such that the range n^e to (n+1)^e always contains a prime. Let k be the intersection of all the k(n) intervals for n up to N. Then k is the set of exponents e such that there is always a prime in the range n^e to (n+1)^e for n<=N. The number K is the least number in the set k. It appears that as N becomes larger, the set k converges. See A143935. [_T. D.
