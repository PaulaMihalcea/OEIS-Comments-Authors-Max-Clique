The choices for constructing the next partition are: either remove some parts from the partition, but with the condition that if any summand k is removed, then all copies of k present in partition must be removed in toto. One may remove all copies of several distinct summands as well. If by such a removal of parts we can find any smaller partitions that have not yet occurred in the sequence, then we choose the one which has the smallest Heinz encoding value. On the other hand, if all partitions obtained by such removals have already occurred in the sequence, then one adds to the current partition the least number of copies of the least positive integer that is not yet a part of the partition (see A257993), until a partition is found which is not yet in the sequence.

This follows because clearly (in case A) when a(n) < a(n+1) < a(n+2) then (a(n+1) / a(n)) is a divisor of a(n+2) because on ascending subsections each successive term is obtained by multiplying by some prime (or its power) not already present.
