For example, a(17) = 1734 with (a,b,c) = (51, 68, 85) and a(18) = 1710 with (a,b,c) = (57, 65, 68).", "Another interesting property of this sequence is that a(n) is divisible by 6 and, except n = 3, a(n)/6 = n^2 if n prime, hence the proposition:", "Among the set of triangles whose area and sides are integers and whose inradius r is a prime number other than 3, the smallest area A is given by A = 6r^2.", "Example: if r = 5, the areas of the triangles are {150, 210, 270, 330, 390, 510, ...} and the smallest area of them is A = 6*5^2 = 150 because 5 is prime.", "Proof: Let r be a number such that the sides of a triangle are a = 3r, b = 4r, c = 5r. Then s = (a+b+c)/2 = 6r and A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) = sqrt(36r^4) = 6r^2 is a possible area. Is 6r^2 the smallest area?

Since m, n and l have to be of the same parity for a, b and c to be integral, they must therefore be even. Setting l = 2u, m = 2v, and n = 2w, we have a = v+w, b = w+u, c = u+v, and uvw = r^2(u+v+w).

The area A is the corresponding value of the triangle (u,v,w) = (1*p, 2*p, 3*p) because 6p^3/6p = p^2. However, inradius(A') = p => u'v'w'/(u'+v'+w') = p^2 => (u',v',w') = (u,v,w) and A is the smallest area.", "Second case: If r = q is composite, the triangle (u,v,w) = (1*q, 2*q, 3*q) gives an area A with inradius(A) = q, but it is possible to find A' < A with inradius(A') = q; for example, if q = 10, the triangle (u,v,w) = (30, 20, 10) whose area is A = 600 gives sqrt{(30*20*10)/(30+20+10)} = sqrt(6000/60) = 10 and the triangle(u',v',w') = (24,15,15) whose area is A' = 540 gives sqrt{(24*15*15)/(24+15+15)} = sqrt(5400/54) = 10.", "(End)"], "link": ["David W.
