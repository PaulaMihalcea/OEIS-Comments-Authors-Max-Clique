Corneth_, Sep 22 2016: (Start) Each number can consist of 2^10-1 sets of distinct digits, i.e., classes. For example, 21132 is in the class {1, 2, 3}. We don't include a number without digits. For this sequence, we can also exclude numbers with only the digit 0. This leaves 1022 classes. We create a list with a place for each class containing the least number from that class not already in the sequence.", "To illustrate the algorithm used to create the current b-file, we'll (for brevity) assume we've already calculated all terms for n = 1 to 100 and that we already know which classes will be used to compute the next 10 terms, for n = 101 to 110.", "These classes are:  {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {5, 9}, {7, 9}, {8, 9}, {0, 1, 6}, {0, 1, 7}, {2, 2, 2} and {2, 2, 4} having the values 110, 223, 95, 97, 89, 106, 107, 222 and 224. a(99) = 104 and a(100) = 88, so from those values we may only choose from {223, 95, 97 and 222}. The least value in the list is 95. Therefore, a(101) = 95.
