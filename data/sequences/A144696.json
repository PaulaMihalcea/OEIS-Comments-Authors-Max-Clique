The symmetric group S_n consists of the injective mappings p:[n] -> [n]. Such a permutation p has an excedance at position i, 1 <= i < n, if p(i) > i. One well-known interpretation of the Eulerian numbers A(n,k) is that they count the permutations in the symmetric group S_n with k excedances. The triangle of Eulerian numbers is A008292 (but with an offset of 1 in the column numbering). We generalize this definition to restricted permutations as follows.", "Let r be a nonnegative integer and let Permute(n,n-r) denote the set of injective maps p:[n-r] -> [n], which we think of as permutations of n numbers taken n-r at a time. Clearly, |Permute(n,n-r)| = n!/r!. We say that p has an excedance at position i, 1 <= i <= n-r, if p(i) > i. Then the r-Eulerian number, denoted by A(r;n,k), is defined as the number of permutations in Permute(n,n-r) having k excedances. Thus the current array of 2-Eulerian numbers gives the number of permutations in Permute(n,n-2) with k excedances. See the example section below for some numerical examples.", "Clearly A(0;n,k) = A(n,k). The case r = 1 also produces the ordinary Eulerian numbers A(n,k). There is an obvious bijection from Permute(n,n) to Permute(n,n-1) that preserves the number of excedances of a permutation. Consequently, the 1-Eulerian numbers are equal to the 0-Eulerian numbers: A(1;n,k) = A(0;n,k) = A(n,k).", "For other cases of r-Eulerian numbers see A144697 (r = 3), A144698 (r = 4) and A144699 (r = 5). There is also a concept of r-Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds - see A143491 and A143494. If we multiply the entries of the current array by a factor of 2 and then reverse the rows we obtain A120434.", "An alternative interpretation of the current array due to [Strosser] involves the 2-excedance statistic of a permutation (see also [Foata & Schutzenberger, Chapitre 4, Section 3]). We define a permutation p in Permute(n,n-2) to have a 2-excedance at position i (1 <=i <= n-2) if p(i) >= i + 2.", "Given a permutation p in Permute(n,n-2), define ~p to be the permutation in Permute(n,n-2) that takes i to n+1 - p(n-i-1). The map ~ is a bijection of Permute(n,n-2) with the property that if p has (resp. does not have) an excedance in position i then ~p does not have (resp. has) a 2-excedance at position n-i-1. Hence ~ gives a bijection between the set of permutations with k excedances and the set of permutations with (n-k) 2-excedances. Thus reading the rows of this array in reverse order gives a triangle whose entries count the permutations in Permute(n,n-2) with k 2-excedances.", "Example: Represent a permutation p:[n-2] -> [n] in Permute(n,n-2) by its image vector (p(1),...,p(n-2)). In Permute(10,8) the permutation p = (1,2,4,7,10,6,5,8) does not have an excedance in the first two positions (i = 1 and 2) or in the final three positions (i = 6, 7 and 8). The permutation ~p = (3,6,5,1,4,7,9,10) has 2-excedances only in the first three positions and the final two positions.", "From _Peter Bala_, Dec 27 2019: (Start)", "This is the array A(1,1,3) in the notation of Hwang et al.
