This fact implies that there are arbitrarily large gaps in the distribution of the prime numbers. However, n!+n+1 need not be a prime number. Now a(n) measures, when the next prime number after n!+n appears. Thus a(n)=0 means that n!+n+1 is prime and so on. Obviously, a(n) is parity conserving for n >= 2.
