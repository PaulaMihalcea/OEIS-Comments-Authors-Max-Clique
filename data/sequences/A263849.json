The main result of Maass (1941) is that every totally positive nu in R is a sum of 3 squares x^2+y^2+z^2 with x,y,z in R. The number N_{nu} of such representations is given by the formula in the theorem on page 191. The norms of the totally positive elements nu are rational integers m belonging to A031363, so we can order the terms of the sequence according to the values m = A031363(n).

David Durstoff says: \"I expressed theta(tau) in terms of two variables q1 and q2. The coefficient of q1^k q2^m is a(nu) with k = trace(nu/delta) and m = trace(nu), where delta = (5+sqrt{5})/2 is a generator of the different ideal.
