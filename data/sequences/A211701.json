The class depends on sequences s having n-th term [(n^k)/j], where k and j are arbitrary fixed positive integers and [ ] = floor.

Assume that r(i) is in lowest terms, and let j(i) be its denominator. Then the characteristic polynomial of u is the least common multiple of all the irreducible (over the integers) factors of all the polynomials (x^j(i)-1)(x-1)^k(i). As all such factors are palindromic (indeed, they are all cyclotomic polynomials), the characteristic polynomial of u is also palindromic.
