This means that c(n) = 0 (= a(n) = b(n)) if n is a palindrome; if n is the sum of 2 palindromes, then c(n) = b(n) is the smallest palindrome such that n - c(n) is again a palindrome; if n is the sum of three palindromes, then c(n) is the smallest possible sum of two palindromes such that n - c(n) is the largest possible palindrome.
