In particular, connecting two equal sized components has zero cost. For example, in the case of n=4 there are 5 nodes. Connecting nodes 1 and 2 costs zero, connecting nodes 3 and 4 costs zero, then connecting {5} to {3,4} costs 1 and finally connecting {1,2} to {3,4,5} costs 1 giving a total cost of 2.
