Then S is the set of positive rational numbers, which arise in generations as follows: g(1) = (1/1), g(2) = (1+1) = (2), g(3) = (2+1, 1/2) = (3/1, 1/2), g(4) = (4/1, 1/3, 3/2), ... . Once g(n-1) = (g(1), ..., g(z)) is defined, g(n) is formed from the vector (g(1) + 1, 1/g(1), g(2) + 1, 1/g(2), ..., g(z) + 1, 1/g(z)) by deleting all elements that are in a previous generation. A226080 is the sequence of denominators formed by concatenating the generations g(1), g(2), g(3), ... .
