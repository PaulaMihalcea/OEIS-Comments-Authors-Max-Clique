The para-sequence may be regarded as a sort of \"limit\" of the concatenated segments. The para-sequence (itself not a sequence) is dense in the sense that every pair of terms i and j are separated by another term (and hence separated by infinitely many terms).", "The para-sequence accounts for positions of dyadic rational numbers in the following way: Label 1/2 as 1; label 1/4, 3/4 as 2 and 3; label 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 as 4,5,6,7, etc. Then, for example, the ordering 1/8 < 1/4 < 3/8 < 1/2 < 5/8 < 3/4 < 7/8 matches the labels 4,2,5,1,6,3,7, which is the 3rd segment of A131987.
