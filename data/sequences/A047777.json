Andersen, who also found the next 5 terms a(12)-a(16) and the bound a(17) > 10^32000, cf. Rivera's web page \"Problem 18\". - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 31 2013", "There is a natural variant of the present sequence, using the same definition except for not requiring that all primes have to be distinct. That variant would have the same 3057-digit prime as next term a(9), and therefore have the same displayed terms and not justify a separate entry in the OEIS. However, terms beyond a(9) would be different: instead of a(10) = 73, a(11) = 467 and the 14650-digit PRP a(11), it would be followed by a'(10) = 7, a'(11) = 3 (which cuts a(10) = 73 in two pieces), a'(12) = 467, a'(13) = a'(14) = 2, and a'(15) equal to a 748-digit prime, see the a-file from J.-F.
