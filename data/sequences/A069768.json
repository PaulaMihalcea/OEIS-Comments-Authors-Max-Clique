See further comments there and in A153141.", "This bijection, Knack, is a ENIPS-transformation of the simple swap: ENIPS(*A069770) (i.e., row 1 of A122204). Furthermore, Knack and Knick (the inverse, A069767) have a special property, that FORK and KROF transforms (explained in A122201 and A122202) transform them to their own inverses, i.e., to each other: FORK(Knick) = KROF(Knick) = Knack and FORK(Knack) = KROF(Knack) = Knick, thus this occurs also as row 1 in A122288 and naturally, the double-fork fixes both, e.g., FORK(FORK(Knack)) = Knack.", "Note: the name in Finnish is \"Naks\"."], "reference": ["A.
