So any n=28k, where gcd(42,k)=1, satisfies a(n)<n. This even shows that A095301 does not have asymptotic density zero. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Jul 09 2015", "This sequence is related to Theorem 1 on p. 173 of the Erd\u0151s link in the following way. For a given x, let us consider the set of integers such that a(n) <= x, which is equivalent to removing duplicates from the current sequence. This set would begin with: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, ... So this set has the same number of elements as the number of distinct terms numbers of the form sigma(n)/n with 1 <= n <=x. Then by Erd\u0151s, it is c1*x + o(x), with 6/Pi^2 < c1 < 1. With x = 10^7, we find c1 ~= 0.98208... - _Michel Marcus_, Jul 21 2015", "a(n) is the least k which has the same abundancy index as n, that is, minimal k for which sigma(k)/k = sigma(n)/n. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 10 2019"], "link": ["Robert Israel, <a href=\"/A094759/b094759.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>", "P.
