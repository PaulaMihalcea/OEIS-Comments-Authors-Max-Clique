Assuming the terminals to be point contacts at the periphery of the structure, he proved a general theorem that yields an analytical expression for the sheet resistance Rs. In the special case that the structure is invariant for a rotation of ninety degrees, the formula of Van der Pauw is Rs = (Pi/log(2))*(V/I).", "A general theorem for the sheet resistance Rs of a Van der Pauw structure with finite contacts that is invariant for a rotation of ninety degrees was proved by Versnel. His theorem states that Rs = [K(k1)/K'(k1) - K(k2)/(2*K'(k2))]^(-1)*(V/I) with K(k) and K'(k) complete elliptic integrals with modulus k (Abramowitz and Stegun use parameter m = k^2).", "Versnel found, with a little help from the author, expressions for Rs = C(d)*(V/I) for several Van der Pauw structures if d, the ratio of the sum of the lengths of the contacts and the length of the boundary of the sheet, tends to zero, see the formulas (first two terms are given).
