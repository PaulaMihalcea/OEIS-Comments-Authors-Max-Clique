The first condition is that this is a permutation; this is satisfied because this is a permutation involution. This is because (n+1)/2 is the inverse function of 2n-1, which is applied only if n is not already used in the sequence. The second condition is that, with each new term, max(a(n)/n) increases or min(a(n)/n) decreases. This is obviously the case because the next term would be either 2n-1, with would increase max(a(n)/n), or (n+1)/2, which would decrease min(a(n)/n). The third and last condition is that each new term is the smallest possible number satisfying the first two conditions. This holds because 2n-1 is the smallest possible number m*n+b where the slope m is > 1 and a(1) = 1. (A slope > 1 is needed for condition 2.)", "(End)"], "link": ["<a href=\"/index/Per#IntegerPermutation\">Index entries for sequences that are permutations of the natural numbers</a>"], "formula": ["a(n) = A073675(n-1) + 1. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Dec 27 2020"], "mathematica": ["f[s_] := Block[{n = Length@s}, Append[s, If[MemberQ[s, n], (n + 1)/2, 2n - 1]]]; Rest@Nest[f, {1}, 70] (* _Robert G.
