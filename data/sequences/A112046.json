Because the Jacobi symbol is multiplicative as J(ab,m) = J(a,m)*J(b,m) and if for every index i>=1 and < x, J(i,m)=1, then if J(x,m) is 0 or -1, x cannot be composite (say y*z, with both y and z less than x), as then either J(y,m) or J(z,m) would be non-one, which contradicts our assumption that x is the first index where non-one value appears.
