The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal weakly decreasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is the number of strict ascents in the same composition. For example, the weakly decreasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2),(5,1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 4 - 1 = 3.
