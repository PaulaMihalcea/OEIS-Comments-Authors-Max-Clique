Because these continued fractions are always of the form [b(0),periodic(b(1),b(2),...,b(2),b(1),2*b(0)-1,)] with the symmetric piece b(1),b(2),..., b(2),b(1), Perron op. cit. writes for this b(0),b(1),b(2),...,(b(k/2)) if the period length k is even and b(0),b(1),b(2),...,b((k-1)/2) if the period length is odd. In this example: k=4 and Perron writes 3,2,(1).
