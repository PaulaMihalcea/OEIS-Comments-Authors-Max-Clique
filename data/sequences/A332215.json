Also, like A243071, this bijection maps primes to the terms of A000225 (binary repunits). However, the \"tuning\" (A332213) has a specific effect that each Mersenne prime (A000668) is mapped to itself. Therefore the terms of A335431 are fixed by this map. Furthermore, I conjecture that there are no other fixed points.
