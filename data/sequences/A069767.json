See further comments there.", "This bijection, Knick, is a SPINE-transformation of the simple swap: SPINE(*A069770) (i.e., row 1 of A122203). Furthermore, Knick and Knack (the inverse, *A069768) have a special property, that FORK and KROF transforms (explained in A122201 and A122202) transform them to their own inverses, i.e., to each other: FORK(Knick) = KROF(Knick) = Knack and FORK(Knack) = KROF(Knack) = Knick, thus this occurs also as a row 1 in A122287 and naturally, the double-fork fixes both, e.g., FORK(FORK(Knick)) = Knick.
