(See A243822). If r does not divide n, then it divides some power n^e with e>1, since all the prime divisors p of r divide n. Another way to look at this is that the set of prime divisors p of semidivisor r is a subset of the set of prime divisors p of n, yet r does not itself divide n. The multiplicity of at least one prime divisor p of r exceeds that of the corresponding prime divisor p of n. The maximum possible multiplicity of any number m < n pertains to the largest power of 2 < n, thus the greatest possible value of rho = floor(log2(n)).", "a(n) for n = 2 (mod 4) = floor(log2(n)), since such n is an odd multiple of 2.
