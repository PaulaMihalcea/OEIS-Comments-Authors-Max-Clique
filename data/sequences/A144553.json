There is no guarantee that the values are correct, although presumably Shirakawa has calculated them through a(45). The attached program can be altered to count only achiral polyominoes, and those results match those of A142886, which uses a very different method. The difficulties lie in determining each inner loop (A324408 and A324409) and in determining connections within the inner loop (bad_connection subroutine). The last bug I found in the program affected only polyominoes with 72 or more cells. - _Robert A. Russell_, May 23 2020"], "link": ["Robert A.
