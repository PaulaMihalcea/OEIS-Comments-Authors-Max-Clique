For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100)."], "example": ["The reversed binary expansion of each positive integer together with their co-Lyndon factorizations begins:", "   1:     (1) = (1)", "   2:    (01) = (0)(1)", "   3:    (11) = (1)(1)", "   4:   (001) = (0)(0)(1)", "   5:   (101) = (10)(1)", "   6:   (011) = (0)(1)(1)", "   7:   (111) = (1)(1)(1)", "   8:  (0001) = (0)(0)(0)(1)", "   9:  (1001) = (100)(1)", "  10:  (0101) = (0)(10)(1)", "  11:  (1101) = (110)(1)", "  12:  (0011) = (0)(0)(1)(1)", "  13:  (1011) = (10)(1)(1)", "  14:  (0111) = (0)(1)(1)(1)", "  15:  (1111) = (1)(1)(1)(1)", "  16: (00001) = (0)(0)(0)(0)(1)", "  17: (10001) = (1000)(1)", "  18: (01001) = (0)(100)(1)", "  19: (11001) = (1100)(1)", "  20: (00101) = (0)(0)(10)(1)"], "mathematica": ["colynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]]@Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]];", "Table[Length[colynfac[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]]]],{n,100}]"], "xref": ["The non-\"co\" version is A211100.", "Positions of 2's are A329357.", "Numbers whose binary expansion is co-Lyndon are A275692.", "Length of the co-Lyndon factorization of the binary expansion is A329312.", "Cf.
