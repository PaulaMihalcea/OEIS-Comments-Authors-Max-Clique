Two integers are equivalent if and only if they are mapped by P_k to the same value. For P_5, P_6 and P_7 see the arrays (not the triangles) A090298, A092260 and A113807, respectively. In each of these cases the class [k] should be replaced by the class [0], and also negative n-values are allowed. Multiplication can be done class-wise. E.g., k = 5: P_5(n) = a(n), 7*12 == 3*2 = 6 == 4. a(7*12) = a(a(7)*a(12)) = a(3*2) = 4. This kind of multiplication could be called multiplication Modd n, in order to distinguish it from multiplication mod n. Addition cannot be done class-wise: e.g., 7 + 12 = 19 == 1 is not equivalent to 3 + 2 = 5 == 0. a(7+12) = 1 is not equal to a(a(7) + a(12)) = a(3+2) = 0.", "Periodic sequences of this type can be also calculated by a(n) = c + floor(q/(p^m-1)*p^n) mod p, where c is a constant, q is the number representing the periodic digit pattern and m is the period length. c, p and q can be calculated as follows: Let D be the array representing the number pattern to be repeated, m = size of D, max = maximum value of elements in D, min = minimum value of elements in D. Than c := min, p := max - min + 1 and q := p^m*sum_{i = 1..m} (D(i) - min)/p^i. Example: D = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1), c = 0, m = 10, p = 5 and q = 606836 for this sequence. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 04 2013", "For periodic sequences with terms < 10 one can use the well-known fact that ab..z/99..9 = 0.ab..zab..zab..z...
