Explanation on the example n=10. Write 2*n = 20 as a binary number: 10100. Consider a Ferrers board whose southeast border is obtained by replacing each 1 by an east step and each 0 by a north step. We obtain the Ferrers board of the partition p = (2,2,1). Finally, a(10) = 2'*2'*1', where m' = m-th prime.
