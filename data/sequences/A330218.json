The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges."], "example": ["The sequence of set-systems together with their BII-numbers begins:", "      0: {}", "      5: {{1},{1,2}}", "     12: {{1,2},{3}}", "    180: {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{4}}", "  35636: {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,4},{2,4},{3,4},{5}}", "     13: {{1},{1,2},{3}}"], "mathematica": ["bpe[n_]:=Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1];", "graprms[m_]:=Union[Table[Sort[Sort/@(m/.Apply[Rule,Table[{p[[i]],i},{i,Length[p]}],{1}])],{p,Permutations[Union@@m]}]];", "dv=Table[Length[graprms[bpe/@bpe[n]]],{n,0,1000}];", "Table[Position[dv,i][[1,1]]-1,{i,First[Split[Union[dv],#1+1==#2&]]}]"], "xref": ["Positions of first appearances in A330231.", "The MM-number version is A330230.", "Achiral set-systems are counted by A083323.", "BII-numbers of fully chiral set-systems are A330226.", "Cf.
