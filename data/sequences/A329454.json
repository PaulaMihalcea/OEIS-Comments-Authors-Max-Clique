There is some hope that this could be the case, and it seems coherent to choose offset 0 not only in view of this. The restriction to positive indices would then be a permutation of the positive integers, but not the smallest one with the given property.", "Concerning the existence of the sequence: If the sequence is to be computed in a greedy manner, this means that for given n, we assume given P(n) := {a(n-1), a(n-2), a(n-3)} and thus S(n) := #{ primes x + y with x, y in P(n), x < y} which may equal 0, 1, 2 or 3. We have to find a(n) such that we have exactly 3 - S(n) primes in a(n) + P(n). It is easy to prove that this is always possible when 3 - S(n) is 0 or 1, and similar to the case of A329452 and A329453 when S(n) = 1. When S(n) = 0, however, we must find three primes in the same configuration as the elements of P(n). It is almost surprising that this can always be found up to n = 10^6. However, the sequence needs not to be computable in greedy manner. That is, if for given P(n) no a(n) would exist such that a(n) + P(n) contains 3 - S(n) primes, this simply means that the considered value of a(n-1) was incorrect, and the next larger choice has to be made. Given this freedom, well-definedness of this sequence up to infinity is far more probable than, for example, the k-tuple conjecture.", "Computational results are as follows:", "a(10^5) = 99954 and all numbers below 99915 have appeared at that point.", "a(10^6) = 1000053 and all numbers below 999845 have appeared at that point."], "link": ["Eric Angelini, <a href=\"http://cinquantesignes.blogspot.com/2019/11/prime-sums-from-neighbouring-terms.html\">Prime sums from neighbouring terms</a>, personal blog \"Cinquante signes\" (and post to the SeqFan list), Nov. 11, 2019."], "example": ["We start with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, the smallest possibilities which do not lead to a contradiction.", "Now there are already 2 primes, 0 + 2 and 1 + 2, among the pairwise sums, so the next term must generate exactly one further prime.
