It is given as the value of the degree 45 polynomial R(45, x) (see A127672 for the R coefficients), a monic Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. A known identity is R(2*k+1, x) = x*(-1)^k*S(2*k, sqrt(4-x^2)), with the Chebyshev S polynomials (see A049310 for the coefficients). In trigonometric version this is R_{2*k+1}(2*sin(theta)) = 2*(-1)^k*sin((2*k+1)*theta). See also the Havil reference, bottom of p. 73 (with P for R, and a missing (-1)^k). For k = 22 this allows us to give all 45 possible x values. One of them is the obvious x1 = 2*sin(43*Pi/(45*128)). Another simpler one is x = 2*sin((37/384)*Pi) given in A303983. In the exemplum secundum, Romanus gives in the first link the wrong solution sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)))))) which is in trigonometric version 2*sin((1/128)*Pi). This is not among the 45 solutions. In the second link there is a correction of the x value (the last number is now sqrt(3), not sqrt(2)). This is, in trigonometric version, 2*sin(Pi/192) = A302714. However, this is also not the correct value for the given value of the polynomial.", "Note that in the Vieta (1595) link, p. 5 (using R. bin. instead of r bin., R. bin.), this exemplum secundum is rewritten with the same polynomial value and the x value sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)))))) = A302714. As just explained this is incorrect.", "The correct polynomial value of R(45, x) for the x given by Romanus in the first link (that is, 2*sin((1/128)*Pi)) is, by the above mentioned identity, 2*sin((45/128)*Pi, given in A303984.", "For the other three exempla of Romanus see also the Havil reference, problems 1 (A302711, A302712), 3 (A179260, A302715), and 4 (A272534, A302716).
