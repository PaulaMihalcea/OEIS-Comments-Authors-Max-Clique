Proof: Dyson defined the rank of a partition as the largest part minus the number of parts. On the other hand the total number of parts in all partitions of n equals the sum of largest parts of all partitions of n (Cf. A006128), hence the sum of the ranks of all partitions of n is equal to zero. Let p(n) be the number of partitions of n. If we now add an part equal to 1 in each partition of n we obtain the partitions of n+1 that contain 1 as a part. The sum of the ranks of these partitions is p(n)*(-1) because the largest parts are the same but now there is an additional part in each partition. On the other hand the sum of the ranks of all partitions of n+1 is equal to zero, hence the sum of the ranks of all partitions of n+1 that do not contain 1 as a part is equal to p(n)."], "link": ["A.
