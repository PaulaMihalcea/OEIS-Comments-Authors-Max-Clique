This information is enough to determine the modulo 6 residues of all the divisors of n, thus sequences like A002324 are essentially functions of this sequence. Moreover, a lots of other information is immediately (and unavoidably) present, for example the exact prime signature of n, including also the relative order of exponents.", "Any such filtering sequence can be perceived also in terms of what information it leaves out from a(n) that would be needed to reconstruct whole n from each a(n). If the whole n could be reconstructed from a(n) each time, then sequence a would be injective, and would be useless for filtering, because then it would match with any sequence. In this filter, what is left out is only the exact identity of the smallest prime factor, although its residue class mod 6 is retained. However, when the smallest prime factor is 2 or 3, this can be seen from that residue value, so for any number x in A047229, both A020639(x) and A032742(x) are known, and as x = A020639(x)*A032742(x), it means such numbers must occur in their own singleton equivalence classes.", "Likewise, for any n in A283050, even if not divisible by 2 or 3, when we have A319710(n) stored in the triple as 1, this immediately gives away the exact identity of the smallest prime factor, which is equal to A014673(n) = A020639(A032742(n)) in these cases.", "  Thus there is a substantial subset of N, (containing at least the union of A047229 and A283050), which is actually in the \"blind sector\" of this filter, \"where anything goes\", as this sequence obtains only unique values in that subdomain.", "  There is a related filter sequence A319996, which operates by \"cleaving n from its high end\" (by storing the residue class of the largest prime factor, A006530, instead of the smallest, together with n/A006530(n)), which has its own blind spots, but fortunately, they do not fully coincide with the blind spots of this filter.
