Adams-Watters_: (Start)", "Any permutation of the runs of n gives another such permutation when reversed. This pairs up all non-palindromic permutations of the runs of n. Thus the parity of A175096(n) is the parity of the number of palindromic run-permutations of n.

Therefore, if we subtract 1 from each term of A164126, we get the sequence of run lengths of 0's. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Feb 19 2012.", "Given an index n such that a(n)=0, then p=A206913(n) is the greatest index p<n such that a(p)=1, hence, a(k)=0 for all k with p<k<=n. Similarly, q=A206914(n) is the least index q>n such that a(q)=1, which implies a(k)=0 for all k with n<=k<q. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Feb 19 2012.", "Binary palindromes are distributed symmetrically with respect to threefold multiples of powers of 2. This becomes obvious by the generating function g(x) below. Example for the resulting factors of x^(3*2^5)=x^96: the factors are x^q and x^(-q) for q=3,11,23,31. Thus, the palindromes are 96+3, 96-3, 96+11, 96-11, 96+23, 96-23, 96+31, 96-31. The respective number of palindromes with this property is 2^(floor(m/2)), where m is the exponent of the corresponding power of 2. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Apr 04 2012"], "link": ["Reinhard Zumkeller, <a href=\"/A178225/b178225.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..10000</a>", "<a href=\"/index/Ch#char_fns\">Index entries for characteristic functions</a>"], "formula": ["a(A006995(n)) = 1; a(A154809(n)) = 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 21 2011", "a(n) = if A030101(n) = n then 1, otherwise 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jan 17 2012", "a(n) = 1 - (A206916(n) - A206915(n)). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Feb 18 2012", "G.f.: g(x) = 1 + x + x^3 + Sum{j>=1} x^(3*2^j)*(f_j(x)+f_j(1/x)), where the f_j(x) are defined as follows:", "  f_1(x)=x, and for j > 1,", "  f_j(x) = x^3*Product_{k=1..floor((j-1)/2)} (1+x^b(j,k)), where b(j,k) = 2^(floor((j-1)/2)-k)*((3+(-1)^j)*2^(2*k+1)+4) for k > 1, and b(j,1) = (2+(-1)^j)*2^(floor((j-1)/2)+1).
