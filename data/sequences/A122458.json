We stop counting when the iteration produces a number less than the initial 2n+1. For a fixed dropping time k, let N(k)=A100982(k) and P(k)=2^(A020914(k)-1). There are exactly N(k) odd numbers less than P(k) with dropping time k. Moreover, the sequence is periodic: if d is one of the N(k) odd numbers, then k=a(d)=a(d+i*P(k)) for all i>0. This periodicity makes it easy to compute the average dropping time of the reduced Collatz iteration: sum_{k>0} k*N(k)/P(k) = 3.492651852186..."], "reference": ["Victor Klee and Stan Wagon, Old and New Unsolved Problems in Plane Geometry and Number Theory, Mathematical Association of America (1991) pp. 225-229, 308-309.
