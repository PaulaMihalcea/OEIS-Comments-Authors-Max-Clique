If we take the prime factorization of n = (p1^e1)*(p2^e2)* ... * (pj^ej) then a(n) = |{k: ek>=4}| + ((j-1)/2)*|{k: ek>=3}| + C(|{k: ek>=2}|,2) + C(j,4). The first term is the number of distinct 4th powers of primes in the factors of n (the first way of finding a 4-almost prime). The second term is the number of distinct cubes of primes, each of which can be multiplied by any of the other distinct primes, halved to avoid double-counts (the second way of finding a 4-almost prime). The third term is the number of distinct pairs of squares of primes in the factors of n (the third way of finding a 4-almost prime). The 4th term is the number of distinct products of 4 distinct primes, which is the number of combinations of j primes in the factors of n taken 4 at a time, A000332(j), (the 4th way of finding a 4-almost prime)."], "reference": ["Hardy, G.
