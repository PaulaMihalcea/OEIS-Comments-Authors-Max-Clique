The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.", "In a set-system, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges containing it."], "example": ["The BII-number of {{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}} is 62, and its degrees are (2,3,3), so a(62) = 3."], "mathematica": ["bpe[n_]:=Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1];", "Table[If[n==0,0,Max@@Length/@Split[Sort[Join@@bpe/@bpe[n]]]],{n,0,100}]"], "xref": ["Positions of 1's are A326701 (BII-numbers of set-partitions).", "The minimum vertex-degree is A327103.", "Positions of 2's are A327106.", "Cf.
