The n-th row of the triangular table begins by considering A000217(n) pentagonal numbers (starting with 1) in order. Now segregate them into n chunks beginning with n members in the first chunk, n-1 members in the second chunk, and so forth. Now sum each chunk. Thus the first term is the sum of first n numbers = n*(3n-1)/2, the second term is the sum of the next n-1 terms (from n+1 to 2n-1), the third term is the sum of the next n-2 terms (2n to 3n-3)... This triangle can be called the pentagonal triangle. The sequence contains the triangle by rows.
