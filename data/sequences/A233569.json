For example, 6~5, 14~13~11, 12~9.", "Denote by (10...0)^k the concatenation k the same consecutive parts (10...0). By agreement, (10...0)^0 denotes the absence of the corresponding part in the binary of n. Let n contains k_i parts with i-1 zeros, i=1,2,... . Then n~concatenation((1)^k_1, (10)^k_2,(100)^k_3,...). The latter number is a(n). Thus a(n_1)=a(n_2) if and only if n_1~n_2. For example, since a(19)=28 which is in binary 11100, then the canonical representation of 19 is (1)^2[*](100), where [*] means concatenation. Analogously, since a(23)=30 which in binary 11110, then the canonical representation of 23 is (1)^3[*](10).", "As a natural application, consider a notion of parts power divisor of canonical representation of n. We consider parts power divisors only of the form a(m).", "If the canonical representation of n is a(n)=(1)^k_1[*](10)^k_2[*](100)^k_3[*]..., then number a(m) is a parts power divisor  of a(n), iff a(m)=(1)^t_1[*](10)^t_2[*](100)^t_3[*]... with all t_i<=k_i. In particular, 0 (with all t_i=0) is parts power divisor of every a(n). From this it follows that the number of primes power divisors of a(n) is (k_1+1)*(k_2+1)*...
