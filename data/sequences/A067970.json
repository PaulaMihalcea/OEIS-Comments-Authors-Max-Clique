No other even number arises. Therefore sequence consists of {8,6,4,2}.", "Proof: If x is an odd nonprime, then x+2=next-odd-number is either nonprime[Case1] or it is a prime [Case 2]. In Case 1 the difference is 2. E.g., x=25, x+2=27, the actual difference is d=2.", "In Case 2 x+2=p=prime. Distinguish two further sub-cases. In Case 2a: x+2=p=prime and p+2=x+4=q is also a prime. Then x+2+2+2=x+6 will not be prime because in first difference sequence of prime no d=2 occurs twice except for p+2=3+2=5,5+2=7, i.e., when p is divisible by 3; for 6k+1 and 6k+5 primes it is impossible. Consequently x+6 is not a prime and so the difference between two consecutive odd nonprimes is 6. Example: x=39, x+2=41=smaller twin prime and next odd nonprime x+6=45, d=6", "In Case 2b: x+2=p=prime, but x+2+2=x+4 is not a prime, i.e., x+2=p is not a smaller one of a twin-prime pair. Thus x+4 is the next odd nonprime. Thus the difference=4. E.g., x=77, x+2=79, so the next odd nonprime is x+4=81, d=4. No more cases.
