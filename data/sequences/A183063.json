More generally, it appears that the sequence formed by starting with an initial set of k-1 zeros followed by the members of A000005, with k-1 zeros between every one of them, can be defined as \"the number of divisors of n that are divisible by k\", (k >= 1). For example if k = 1 we have A000005 by definition, if k = 2 we have this sequence. Note that if k >= 3 the sequences are not included in the OEIS because the usual OEIS policy is not to include sequences like this where alternate terms are zero; this is an exception. - _Omar E.
