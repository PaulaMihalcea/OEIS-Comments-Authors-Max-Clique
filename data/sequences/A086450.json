Assume the conjecture is true up to n = 14k. Then the 7 next odd entries a(14k+1), a(14k+3), ..., a(14k+13) are read from a(7k) to a(7k+6), which follow the correct mod 2 pattern by assuption. For the even entries a(14k), a(14k+10)... a(14k+12), the sum over the first 7k-1 addends is even, simply because of each consecutive 7 addends exactly 4 are odd. So again a(7k) to a(7k+6) determines the outcome and again gives the desired pattern. a(14k) is odd, since a(7k) is odd, a(14k+2) is even, since a(7k) and a(7k+1) are odd and so on ... - Lambert Herrgesell (zero815(AT)googlemail.com), May 08 2007"], "link": ["Alois P.
