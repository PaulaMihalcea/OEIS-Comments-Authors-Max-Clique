Then S is the set of positive integers, which arise in generations. Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2), g(3) = (3), g(4) = (4,5), etc. Concatenating these gives A232638, a permutation of the positive integers. For n > 1, the number of numbers in g(n) is F(n-1), where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers.
