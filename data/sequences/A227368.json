This sequence gives such a minimal integer for each n, which encodes an unordered partition whose sum is n. The details of the encoding system are explained in A227183.", "Also, a(n) gives the index of the first row of A227189/A227739 which sums to n.", "Project: Find an algorithm which computes a(n) with a more sophisticated method than just by a blind search. This is a kind of an optimization problem for representing n as a special \"bit-packed\" sum: the smallest summand of size x costs x bits, and its any subsequent usage in the sum costs just one bit each time. Using any additional summand y > x costs (y-x)+1 bits when used first time, and then again additional usages cost only one bit each. Goal: minimize the number of bits needed. If multiple candidates with the same number of bits are found, then the one which results the smallest integer (when interpreted as a binary number) wins.", "For any composite n = t*u, the upper bound for the size of a(n) is t+u-1 bits.", "A000267(n) seems to give the binary width of a(n+1).
