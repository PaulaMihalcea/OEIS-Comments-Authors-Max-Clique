Adamson_: Iterative sequence in 2^n subsets generated from binomial transform operations. Let S = a string s(1) through s(2^n); and B = appended string. Say S = (1, 1, 2, 1). Perform the binomial transform operation on S as a vector: [1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0...] = 1, 2, 5, 11, 21, 36... Then, performing the analogous operation on B gives a truncated version of the previous sequence: (2, 5, 11, 21,...). Given a subset s(1) through s(2^n), say s(1),...s(4) = (a,b,c,d). Use the operation ((a+b), (b+c), (c+d), d) and append the result to the right of the previous string. Perform the next operation on s(1) through s(2^(n+1)). s(1)...s(4) = (1, 1, 2, 1). The operation gives ((1+1), (1+2), (2+1), (1)) = (2, 3, 3, 1) which we append to (1, 1, 2, 1), giving s(1) through s(8): (1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1)."], "link": ["N. J. A.
