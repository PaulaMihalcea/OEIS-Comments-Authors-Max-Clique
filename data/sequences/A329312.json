For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100).", "Also the length of the Lyndon factorization of the inverted binary expansion of n, where the inverted digits are 1 minus the binary digits."], "example": ["The binary indices of 1..20 together with their co-Lyndon factorizations are:", "   1:     (1) = (1)", "   2:    (10) = (10)", "   3:    (11) = (1)(1)", "   4:   (100) = (100)", "   5:   (101) = (10)(1)", "   6:   (110) = (110)", "   7:   (111) = (1)(1)(1)", "   8:  (1000) = (1000)", "   9:  (1001) = (100)(1)", "  10:  (1010) = (10)(10)", "  11:  (1011) = (10)(1)(1)", "  12:  (1100) = (1100)", "  13:  (1101) = (110)(1)", "  14:  (1110) = (1110)", "  15:  (1111) = (1)(1)(1)(1)", "  16: (10000) = (10000)", "  17: (10001) = (1000)(1)", "  18: (10010) = (100)(10)", "  19: (10011) = (100)(1)(1)", "  20: (10100) = (10100)"], "mathematica": ["colynQ[q_]:=Array[Union[{RotateRight[q,#],q}]=={RotateRight[q,#],q}&,Length[q]-1,1,And];", "colynfac[q_]:=If[Length[q]==0,{},Function[i,Prepend[colynfac[Drop[q,i]],Take[q,i]]]@Last[Select[Range[Length[q]],colynQ[Take[q,#]]&]]];", "Table[Length[colynfac[IntegerDigits[n,2]]],{n,100}]"], "xref": ["The non-\"co\" version is A211100.", "Positions of 1's are A275692.", "The reversed version is A329326.", "Cf.
