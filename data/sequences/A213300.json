Proof of existence: Define m(n):=2*sum_{j=i..k} 10^j, where k:=floor((sqrt(8n+1)-1)/2), i:= n - k(k+1)/2. For n=0,1,2,3,... the m(n) are 2, 22, 20, 222, 220, 200, 2222, 2220, 2200, 2000, 22222, 22220, ... . m(n) has k+1 digits and (k-i+1) 2\u2019s. Thus the number of nonprime substrings of m(n) is ((k+1)(k+2)/2)-k-1+i=(k(k+1)/2)+i=n. This proves existence. Proof of finiteness: Each 4-digit number has at least 1 nonprime substring. Hence each 4*(n+1)-digit number has at least n+1 nonprime substrings. Consequently, there is a boundary b < 10^(4n+3) such that all numbers > b have more than n nonprime substrings. It follows that the set of numbers with n nonprime substrings is finite.", "The following statements hold true:", "For all n>=0 there are minimal numbers with n nonprime substrings (cf.
