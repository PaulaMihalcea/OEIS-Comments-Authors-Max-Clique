The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.", "The spanning edge-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of edges that must be removed (without removing incident vertices) to obtain a set-system that is disconnected or covers fewer vertices."], "example": ["Positions of first appearances of each integer together with the corresponding set-systems:", "     0: {}", "     1: {{1}}", "    52: {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}", "   116: {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}", "  3952: {{1,3},{2,3},{1,4},{2,4},{3,4},{1,2,3},{1,2,4}}", "  8052: {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,4},{2,4},{3,4},{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{1,3,4}}"], "mathematica": ["bpe[n_]:=Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1];", "csm[s_]:=With[{c=Select[Tuples[Range[Length[s]],2],And[OrderedQ[#],UnsameQ@@#,Length[Intersection@@s[[#]]]>0]&]},If[c=={},s,csm[Sort[Append[Delete[s,List/@c[[1]]],Union@@s[[c[[1]]]]]]]]];", "spanEdgeConn[vts_,eds_]:=Length[eds]-Max@@Length/@Select[Subsets[eds],Union@@#!=vts||Length[csm[#]]!=1&];", "Table[spanEdgeConn[Union@@bpe/@bpe[n],bpe/@bpe[n]],{n,0,100}]"], "xref": ["Dominated by A327103.", "The same for cut-connectivity is A326786.", "The same for non-spanning edge-connectivity is A326787.", "The same for vertex-connectivity is A327051.", "Positions of 1's are A327111.", "Positions of 2's are A327108.", "Positions of first appearance of each integer are A327147.", "Cf.
