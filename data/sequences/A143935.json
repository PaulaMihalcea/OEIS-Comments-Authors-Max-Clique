This value of K was found using exact interval arithmetic. For each n <= 300 and for each prime p in the range n to n^2, we computed an interval k(n,p) such that p is between n^k(n,p) and (n+1)^k(n,p). The intersection of all these intervals produces a list of 29 intervals. The last interval appears to be semi-infinite beginning with K, which is log(127)/log(16).
